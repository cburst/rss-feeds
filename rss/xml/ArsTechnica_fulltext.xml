&lt;p&gt;“These are just the difficulties of designing a spacesuit for the lunar environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crew members traveling to the lunar surface on NASA’s Artemis missions should be gearing up for a grind. They will wear heavier spacesuits than those worn by the Apollo astronauts, and NASA will ask them to do more than the first Moonwalkers did more than 50 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moonwalking experience will amount to an “extreme physical event” for crews selected for the Artemis program’s first lunar landings, a former NASA astronaut told a panel of researchers, physicians, and engineers convened by the National Academies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Rubins, whoretired from the space agencylast year, presentedthe committeewith her views on the health risks for astronauts on lunar missions. She outlined the concerns NASA officials often talk about: radiation exposure, muscle and bone atrophy, reduced cardiovascular and immune function, and other adverse medical effects of spaceflight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists and astronauts have come to understand many of these effects after a quarter-century of continuous human presence on the International Space Station. But the Moon is different in a few important ways. The Moon is outside the protection of the Earth’s magnetosphere, lunar dust is pervasive, and the Moon has partial gravity, about one-sixth as strong as the pull we feel on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these presents challenges for astronauts living and working on the lunar surface, and their effects are amplified for crew members who venture outside for spacewalks. NASA selected Axiom Space, a Houston-based company, for a$228 million fixed-price contractto develop commercial pressurized spacesuits for the Artemis III mission, slated to be the first human landing mission on the Moon since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA hopes to fly the Artemis III mission by the end of 2028, but the schedule is in question. The readiness of Axiom’s spacesuits and the availability of new human-rated landers from SpaceX and Blue Origin are driving the timeline for Artemis III.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubins is a veteran of two long-duration spaceflights on the International Space Station, logging 300 days in space and conducting four spacewalks totaling nearly 27 hours. She is also an accomplished microbiologist and became the first person to sequence DNA in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I think we have on the Moon that we don’t really have on the space station that I want people to recognize is an extreme physical stress,” Rubins said. “On the space station, most of the time you’re floating around. You’re pretty happy. It’s very relaxed. You can do exercise. Every now and then, you do an EVA (Extravehicular Activity, or spacewalk).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we get to the lunar surface, people are going to be sleep shifting,” Rubins said. “They’re barely going to get any sleep. They’re going to be in these suits for eight or nine hours. They’re going to be doing EVAs every day. The EVAs that I did on my flights, it was like doing a marathon and then doing another marathon when you were done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubins is now a professor of computational and systems biology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. She said treks on the Moon will be “even more challenging” than her spacewalks outside the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Axiom spacesuit design builds on NASA’s own work developing a prototype suit to replace the agency’s decades-old Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) used for spacewalks at the International Space Station (ISS). The new suits allow for greater mobility, with more flexible joints to help astronauts use their legs, crouch, and bend down—things they don’t have to do when floating outside the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronauts on the Moon also must contend with gravity. Including a life-support backpack, the commercial suit weighs more than 300 pounds in Earth’s gravity, but Axiom considers the exact number proprietary. The Axiom suit is considerably heavier than the 185-pound spacesuit the Apollo astronauts wore on the Moon. NASA’s earlier prototype exploration spacesuit was estimated to weigh more than 400 pounds, according to a2021 report by NASA’s inspector general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve definitely seen trauma from the suits, from the actual EVA suit accommodation,” said Mike Barratt, a NASA astronaut and medical doctor. “That’s everything from skin abrasions to joint pain to—no kidding—orthopedic trauma. You can potentially get a fracture of sorts. EVAs on the lunar surface with a heavily loaded suit and heavy loads that you’re either carrying or tools that you’re reacting against, that’s an issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On paper, the Axiom suits for NASA’s Artemis missions are more capable than the Apollo suits. They can support longer spacewalks and provide greater redundancy, and they’re made of modern materials to enhance flexibility and crew comfort. But the new suits are heavier, and for astronauts used to spacewalks outside the ISS, walks on the Moon will be a slog, Rubins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think the suits are better than Apollo, but I don’t think they are great right now,” Rubins said. “They still have a lot of flexibility issues. Bending down to pick up rocks is hard. The center of gravity is an issue. People are going to be falling over. I think when we say these suits aren’t bad, it’s because the suits have been so horrible that when we get something slightly less than horrible, we get all excited and we celebrate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavier lunar suits developed for Artemis missions run counter to advice from former astronaut Harrison “Jack” Schmitt, who spent 22 hours walking on the Moon during NASA’s Apollo 17 mission in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d have that go about four times the mobility, at least four times the mobility, and half the weight,” Schmitt said in aNASA oral history interview in 2000. “Now, one way you can… reduce the weight is carry less consumables and learn to use consumables that you have in some other vehicle, like a lunar rover. Anytime you’re on the rover, you hook into those consumables and live off of those, and then when you get off, you live off of what’s in your backpack. We, of course, just had the consumables in our backpack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASAwon’t have a roveron the first Artemis landing mission. That will come on a later flight. A fully pressurized vehicle for astronauts to drive across the Moon may be ready sometime in the 2030s. Until then, Moonwalkers will have to tough it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do crossfit. I do triathlons. I do marathons. I get out of a session in the pool in the NBL (Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory) doing the lunar suit underwater, and I just want to go home and take a nap,” Rubins told the panel. “I am absolutely spent. You’re bruised. This is an extreme physical event in a way that the space station is not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barratt met with the same National Academies panel this week and presented a few hours before Rubins. The committee was chartered to examine how human explorers can enable scientific discovery at sites across the lunar surface. Barratt had a more favorable take on the spacesuit situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is not a commercial for Axiom. I don’t promote anyone, but their suit is getting there,” Barratt said. “We’ve got 700 hours of pressurized experience in it right now. We do a lot of tests in the NBL, and there are techniques and body conditioning that you do to help you get ready for doing things like this. Bending down in the suit is really not too bad at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubins and Barratt did not discuss the schedule for when Axiom’s lunar spacesuit will be ready to fly to the Moon, but the conversation illuminated the innumerable struggles of spacewalking, Moonwalking, and the training astronauts undergo to prepare for extravehicular outings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke directly with Rubins after her discussion with the National Academies. Her last assignment at NASA was as chief of the EVA and robotics branch in the astronaut office, where she assisted in the development of the new lunar spacesuits. I asked about her experiences testing the lunar suit and her thoughts on how astronauts should prepare for Moonwalks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The suits that we have are definitely much better than Apollo,” Rubins said in the interview. “They were just big bags of air. The joints aren’t in there, so it was harder to move. What they did have going for them was that they were much, much lighter than our current spacesuits. We have added a lot of the joints back, and that does get some mobility for us. But at the end of the day, the suits are still quite heavy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can divide the weight of the suit by six to get an idea of how it might feel to carry it around on the lunar surface. While it won’t feel like 300 pounds, astronauts will still have to account for their mass and momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubins explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of kind of floating in microgravity and moving your mass around with your hands and your arms, now we’re ambulating. We’re walking with our legs. You’re going to have more strain on your knees and your hips. Your hamstrings, your calves, and your glutes are going to come more into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, overall, it may be a better fit for humans physically because if you ask somebody to do a task, I’m going to be much better at a task if I can use my legs and I’m ambulating. Then I have to pull myself along with my arms… We’re not really built to do that, but we are built to run and to go long distances. Our legs are just such a powerful force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think there are a lot of things lining up that are going to make the physiology easier. Then there are things that are going to be different because we’re we’re now in a partial gravity environment. We’re going to be bending, we’re going to be twisting, we’re going to be doing different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an incredibly hard engineering challenge. You have to keep a human alive in absolute vacuum, warm at temperatures that you know in the polar regions could go as far down as 40 Kelvin (minus 388° Fahrenheit). We haven’t sent humans anywhere that cold before. They are also going to be very hot. They’re going to be baking in the sunshine. You’ve got radiation. If you put all that together, that’s a huge amount of suit material just to keep the human physiology and the human body intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then our challenge is ‘how do you make that mobile?’ It’s very difficult to bend down and pick up a rock. You have to manage that center of gravity because you’re wearing that big life support system on your back, a big pack that has a lot of mass in it, so that brings your center of gravity higher than you’re used to on Earth and a little bit farther backward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you move around, it’s like wearing a really, really heavy backpack that has mass but no weight, so it’s going to kind of tip you back. You can do some things with putting weights on the front of the suit to try to move that center of gravity forward, but it’s still higher, and it’s not exactly at your center of mass that you’re used to on the Earth. On the Earth, we have a center of our mass related to gravity, and nobody ever thinks about it, and you don’t think about it until it moves somewhere else, and then it makes all of your natural motion seem very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are some of the challenges that we’re facing engineering-wise. I think the new suits, they’ve gone a long way toward addressing these, but it’s still a hard engineering challenge. And I’m not talking about any specific suit. I can’t talk about the details of the provider’s suits. This is theNASA xEMUand all the lunar suits I have tested over the years. That includes theMark III suit, the Axiom suit. They have similar issues. So this isn’t really anything about a specific vendor. These are just the difficulties of designing a spacesuit for the lunar environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA trains astronauts for spacewalks in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, an enormous pool in Houston used for simulating weightlessness. They also use a gravity-offloading device to rehearse the basics of spacewalking. The optimal test environment, short of the space environment itself, will be aboard parabolic flights, where suit developers and astronauts can get the best feel for the suit’s momentum, according to Rubins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axiom and NASA are well along assessing the new lunar spacesuit’s performance underwater, but they haven’t put it through reduced-gravity flight testing. “Until you get to the actual parabolic flight, that’s when you can really test the ability to manage this momentum,” Rubins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovering from a fall on the lunar surface comes with its own perils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re face down on the lunar surface, and you have to do the most massive, powerful push up to launch you and the entire mass of the suit up off the surface, high enough so you can then flip your legs under you and catch the ground,” Rubins said. “You basically have to kind of do a jumping pushup… This is a risky maneuver we test a whole bunch in training. It’s really non-trivial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lunar suits are sleeker than the suits NASA uses on the ISS, but they are still bulky. “If you’re trying to kneel, if you’re thinking about bending forward at your waist, all that material in your waist has nowhere to go, so it just compresses and compresses,” Rubins said. “That’s why I say it’s harder to kneel. It’s harder to bend forward because you’re having to compress the suit in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve done these amazing things with joint mobility,” Rubins said. “The mobility around the joints is amazing… but now we’re dealing with this compression issue. And there’s not an obvious engineering fix to that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix to this problem might come in the form of tools instead of changes to the spacesuit itself. Rubins said astronauts could use a staff, or something like a hiking pole, to brace themselves when they need to kneel or bend down. “That way I’m not trying to compress the suit and deal with my balance at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moonwalker suit can comfortably accommodate a wider range of astronauts than NASA’s existing EMUs on the space station. The old EMUs can be resized to medium, large, and extra large, but that leaves gaps and makes the experience uncomfortable for a smaller astronaut. This discomfort is especially noticeable while practicing for spacewalks underwater, where the tug of gravity is still present, Rubins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a female, I never really had an EMU that fit me,” Rubins said. “It was always giant. When I’m translating around or doing something, I’m physically falling and slamming myself, my chest or my back, into one side of the suit or the other underwater, whereas with the lunar suit, I’ve got a suit that fits me right. That’s going to lead to less bruising. Just having a suit that fits you is much better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission planners should also emphasize physical conditioning for astronauts assigned to lunar landing missions. That includes preflight weight and endurance training, plus guidance on what to eat in space to maximize energy levels before astronauts head outside for a stroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That human has to go up really maximally conditioned,” Rubins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubins and Barratt agreed that NASA and its spacesuit provider should be ready to rapidly respond to feedback from future Moonwalkers. Engineers modified and upgraded the Apollo spacesuits in a matter of months, iterating the design between each mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our general design is on a good path,” Rubins said. “We need to make sure that we continue to push for increasing improvements in human performance, and some of that ties back to the budget. Our first suit design is not where we’re going to be done if we want to do a really sustained lunar program. We have to continue to improve, and I think it’s important to recognize that we’re going to learn so many lessons during Artemis III.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barratt has a unique perspective on spacesuit design. He has performed spacewalks at the ISS in NASA’s spacesuit and the Russian Orlan spacesuit. Barratt said the US suit is easier to work in than the Orlan, but the Russian suit is “incredibly reliable” and “incredibly serviceable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It had a couple of glitches, and literally, you unzip a curtain and it’s like looking at my old Chevy Blazer,” Barratt said. “Everything is right there. It’s mechanical, it’s accessible with standard tools. We can fix it. We can do that really easily. We’ve tried to incorporate those lessons learned into our next-generation EVA systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with the NASA suits on the ISS, where one of Barratt’s spacewalks in 2024 was cut short by a spacesuit water leak. “We recently had to return a suit from the space station,” Barratt said. “We’ve got another one that’s sort of offline for a while we’re troubleshooting it. It’s a really subtle problem that’s extremely difficult to work on in places that are hard to access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison Schmitt, speaking with a NASA interviewer in 2000, said his productivity in the Apollo suit “couldn’t have been much more than 10 percent of what you would do normally here on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You take the human brain, the human eyes, and the human hands into space. That’s the only justification you have for having human beings in space,” Schmitt said. “It’s a massive justification, but that’s what you want to use, and all three have distinct benefits in productivity and in gathering new information and infusing data over any automated system. Unfortunately, we have discarded one of those, and that is the hands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schmitt singled out the gloves as the “biggest problem” with the Apollo suits. “The gloves are balloons, and they’re made to fit,” he said. Picking something up with a firm grip requires squeezing against the pressure inside the suit. The gloves can alsodamage astronauts’ fingernails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That squeezing against that pressure causes these forearm muscles to fatigue very rapidly,” Schmitt said. “Just imagine squeezing a tennis ball continuously for eight hours or ten hours, and that’s what you’re talking about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barratt recounted a conversation in which Schmitt, now 90, said he wouldn’t have wanted to do another spacewalk after his three excursions with commander Gene Cernan on Apollo 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Physically, and from a suit-maintenance standpoint, he thought that that was probably the limit, what they did,” Barratt said. “They were embedded with dust. The visors were abraded. Every time they brushed the dust off the visors, they lost visibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the Artemis spacesuit right is vital to the program’s success. You don’t want to travel all the way to the Moon and stop exploring because of sore fingers or an injured knee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you look at what we’re spending on suits versus what we’re spending on the rocket, this is a pretty small amount,” Rubins said. “Obviously, the rocket can kill you very quickly. That needs to be done right. But the continuous improvement in the suit will get us that much more efficiency. Saving 30 minutes or an hour on the Moon, that gives you that much more science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once you have safely landed on the lunar surface, this is where you got to put your money,” Barratt said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/xai-grok-1152x648-1752596823.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s company faces fines of up to 6 percent of its daily turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU has launched a formal investigation into Elon Musk’s xAI following a public outcry over how its Grok chatbot spread sexualized images of women and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The billionaire entrepreneur has come under scrutiny from regulators around the world this month after people began using Grok to generate deepfakes of people without consent. The images were posted on the X social network as well as the separate Grok app, both of which are run by xAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe, announced on Monday under the EU’s Digital Services Act, will assess if xAI tried to mitigate the risks of deploying Grok’s tools on X and the proliferation of content that “may amount to child sexual abuse material.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Non-consensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation,” the EU’s tech chief, Henna Virkkunen, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens—including those of women and children—as collateral damage of its service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the company is found to be in breach of the rules, the bloc can impose fines worth up to 6 percent of the worldwide annual turnover. An EU official said there will be no interim measures during the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European probe comes after UK media regulator Ofcom opened a formal investigation into Grok, while Malaysia and Indonesia have banned the chatbot altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the backlash, xAI restricted the use of Grok to paying subscribers and said it has “implemented technological measures” to limit Grok from generating certain sexualized images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk has also said “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An EU official said that “with the harm that is exposed to individuals that are subject to these images, we have not been convinced so far by what mitigating measures the platform has taken to have that under control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which acquired Musk’s social media site X last year, has designed its AI products to have fewer content “guardrails” than competitors such as OpenAI and Google. Musk called its Grok model “maximally truth-seeking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission fined X €120 million in December last year for breaching its regulations for transparency, providing insufficient access to data and the deceptive design of its blue ticks for verified accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine was criticized by Musk and the US government, with the Trump administration claiming the EU was unfairly targeting American groups and infringing freedom of speech principles championed by the Maga movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X did not immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PineBuds-Pro-4-1152x648-1769443386.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No display? No problem for the UART-to-web-server “Doombuds” project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, hackers and modders at large havemade it their missionto port classic first-person shooterDoomtopracticallyanythingwitha display. Recently, though, coderArin Sarkisanhas taken the “Can it RunDoom?” idea in an unlikely direction: wireless earbuds that aren’t designed to output graphics at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this hack doesn’t apply to any generic set of earbuds.The “Doombuds” projectis designed specifically for thePineBuds Pro, which are unique in featuringcompletely open source firmwareanda community-maintained SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means Sarkisan was able tocode up a JavaScript interfacethat uses the earbuds’UART contact padsto senda heavily compressed MJPEG video streamto a web server (via a serial server). The 2.4 MB/s data stream from the UART connection can put out about 22 to 27 frames per second in this format, which is more than enough for a CPU that can only run the game at a maximum of 18 fps anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squeezing the entirety ofDoomonto modern earbuds wasn’t an easy task, either. The 4.2MB of game data won’t quite fit on the PineBuds’ 4MB of flash memory, for instance. That means the project needed to usea 1.7MB “squashware” build ofDoom, which eliminates some animation frames and shortens some music tracks to make the game even more portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earbuds also have just under 1MB of RAM, requiring the coding ofa new version of the gamethat optimizes away many of the bits that usually fill up a full 4MB of RAM in the standard game. “Pre-generating lookup tables, making variables const, reading const variables from flash, disabling DOOM’s caching system, removing unneeded variables… it all adds up,” Sarkisan writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those without their own PineBuds to test this wild idea, Sarkisan has set upan interactive Twitch streamthat players can queue up to control for 45-second sessionsvia doombuds.com. It’s a great little break-time diversion, especially for people ready to marvel that a set of $70 earbuds can now run a game that required a $1,000-plus computer tower a few decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257704765-1024x648.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US TikTok users experienced a wide range of errors, sparking conspiracies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TikTok has been glitching for US users since Sunday, andTikTok’s new US ownershave finally confirmed the cause: a power outage at a US data center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a US data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate,” the TikTok USDS Joint Venture posted on X on Monday morning. “We’re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We’re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DownDetectorreporttracking outages showed problems began early Sunday morning, with the majority of problems seemingly resolved by early Monday. However, The Vergereportedthat some US users continue to experience issues, including issues logging in, long delays uploading videos, generic content flooding For You pages, problems accessing comments, and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that the TikTok USDS Joint Venture is still working to resolve problems connected to the power outage. But their decision to remain silent while the app got buggy during the first weekend under the control of right-wing US owners hand-picked by Donald Trump sparked conspiracy theories on social media that the app had begun censoring left-leaning users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the app comes back online, users have also taken note that TikTok is collecting more of their data under US control. As Wiredreported, TikTok asked US users to agree to a new terms of service and privacy policy, which allows TikTok to potentially collect “more detailed information about its users, including precise location data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before this update, the app did not collect the precise, GPS-derived location data of US users,” Wired reported. “Now, if you give TikTok permission to use your phone’s location services, then the app may collect granular information about your exact whereabouts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New policies also pushed users to agree to share all their AI interactions, which allows TikTok to store their metadata and trace AI inputs back to specific accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already seeming more invasive and less reliable, for TikTok users, questions likely remain how much their favorite app might change under new ownership, as the TikTok USDS Joint Venture prepares to retrain the app’s algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has said that hewants to see the app become “100 percent MAGA,”prompting fears that “For You” pages might soon be flooded with right-wing content or that leftist content like anti-ICE criticism might be suppressed. And The Informationreportedin July that transferring millions of users over to the US-trained app is expected to cause more “technical issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toad: “So some dinosaur just shows up and he’s now part of the group. Cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universal Pictures and Illumination dropped a new trailer for the upcomingSuper Mario Galaxy Movie,and gaming fans will no doubt be delighted at the news that Yoshi, the little green dinosaur, features prominently, along with plenty of other Easter eggs for sharp-eyed fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspreviously reported, the first attempt at a Super Mario movie adaptation in 1993 was notoriously adismal failure, although it still has its ’90s-nostalgic fans. But 2023’sSuper Mario Bros. Moviewon over gaming fans who were skeptical about another adaptation—includingArs Senior Gaming Editor Kyle Orland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2023 film reintroduced Mario and Luigi, two tight-knit but struggling Brooklyn plumbers who got separated when they unexpectedly fell into the fantastical Mushroom Kingdom. Mario sought Princess Peach’s help to rescue his brother from the evil clutches of Bowser, ruler of the Dark Lands, who was keen to marry Peach and threatened to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom with a Super Star if she refused him. So Peach led Mario on a quest to recruit allies and stop Bowser for good. They succeeded, shrinking Bowser and imprisoning him in a jar. Mario and Luigi moved to the Mushroom Kingdom and continued their plumbing work there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main voice cast is returning for the sequel: Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as the anthropomorphic mushroom Toad, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Bowser’s advisor and informant Kamek. We’re also getting two new cast members: Brie Larson as Princess Rosalina, protector of the cosmos and the Lumas, and Benny Safdie as Bowser, Jr., Bowser’s son and heir to the throne. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic are also back, as is screenwriter Matthew Fogel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details on the actual plot are fuzzy, but the first trailer (released last November) focused on Bowser and Bowser Jr., who seemed intent on freeing his dad and (one assumes) taking revenge on the brothers. This latest trailer shows Mario and Luigi at the scene of a “troubled” pipe in the desert of San Kingdom, populated by the sombrero-wearing Tostarenans. When they clear away some rubble covering an opening, who should be lurking inside but Yoshi—not a monster to hit with fire flowers, but a friendly green dinosaur. Yoshi is keen to join the team, although Toad seems less than impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Super Mario Galaxy Moviehits theaters on April 1, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/win11-pc-2023-1152x648.jpeg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing recovery keys with Microsoft allows the company to unlock your disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2025, Forbesreports, investigators at the FBI served Microsoft with a warrant seeking the BitLocker encryption recovery keys for several laptops it believed held evidence of fraud in Guam’s COVID-19 unemployment assistance program. And Microsoft complied with the FBI’s request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BitLocker is the name of the full-disk encryption technology that has been part of Windows for nearly two decades. Though initially only available to owners of the Pro editions of Windows who turned it on manually,during the Windows 8 eraMicrosoft began using BitLocker to encrypt local disks automatically for all Windows 11 Home and Pro PCs that signed in with a Microsoft account. Using BitLocker in this way also uploads a recovery key for your device to Microsoft’s servers—this makes it possible to unlock your disk so you don’t lose data if something goes wrong with your system, or if you install a CPU upgrade or some other hardware change that breaks BitLocker. But it also (apparently) makes it possible for Microsoft to unlock your disk, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft rep said that the company handled “around 20” similar BitLocker recovery key requests from government authorities per year, and that these requests often fail because users haven’t stored their recovery keys on Microsoft’s servers. Microsoft and other tech companies have generallyrefused requeststo install universal encryption backdoors for law enforcement purposes, and some companies (like Apple)claimto store device encryption keys using another layer of encryption that renders the keys inaccessible to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But storing your device’s recovery keys in someone else’s cloud can still represent a privacy and security risk, especially at a time when the US government has become more interested in targetingjournalistsand the Trump administration’s political opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to encrypt your Windows PC’s disk but you don’t want to store your recovery key with Microsoft, you do have options. We’ll recap the requirements, as well as the steps you’ll need to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we begin: Disk encryption is one of the handful of differences between the Home and Pro versions of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Home and Pro versions of Windows support disk encryption, but only the Pro versions give users full control over the process. The Home version of Windows only supports disk encryption when logged in with a Microsoft account and will only offer to store your encryption key on Microsoft’s servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access the full version of BitLocker and back up your own recovery key, you’ll need to upgrade to the Pro version of Windows. Microsoft offers its own first-party upgrade optionthrough the Microsoft Store for a one-time fee of $99, but it’s also possible to bring your own product key and upgrade yourself. ThisMacworld-affiliated listingfrom StackCommerce claims to be an official Microsoft partner and is offering a Windows 11 Pro key for just $10, though your mileage with third-party key resellers may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However you get it, once you have a valid key, openSettings, thenSystem, thenActivation, clickupgrade your edition of Windows, clickchange product key, and then enter your Windows 11 Pro key (Windows 10 Pro keys should also work, if you already have one). Luckily, changing Windows editions doesn’t require anything more disruptive than a system restart. You won’t need to reinstall Windows, and you shouldn’t lose any of your installed apps or data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once you’ve upgraded a PC to Windows 11 Pro once, you should be able to reinstall and activate Windows 11 Pro on that system again any time you want without having to re-enter your product key. Keep the product key stored somewhere, though, just in case you do need to use it for a reinstall, or if you ever need to re-activate Windows after a hardware upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got Windows 11 Pro set up, it’s time to either encrypt or re-encrypt your disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve signed in with a Microsoft account, your disk is likely already encrypted, and the key is likely already stored on Microsoft’s servers. If this is the case, this process will actually involve fully unencrypting and re-encrypting your drive, which can take an hour or two depending on the speed of your PC and the size of your drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to check your current encryption status and the steps to follow if you’ve already got a key backed up with Microsoft:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your disk is re-encrypted, your PC should work just as it did before. The actual encryption technology hasn’t changed at all—all we’ve done is change where the recovery key is saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does put the burden on the user if and when it comes time to use your recovery key. You’ll have to remember where you put it and not get it mixed up with any other recovery keys you’ve stored for other PCs or old Windows installations. But for anyone concerned about Microsoft giving their device’s encryption keys to the government or anyone else with a valid subpoena, the extra hassle may be worth it in exchange for the added privacy and peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1438737819-1152x648.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staffers warn DOT’s use of Gemini to draft rules could cause injuries and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Transportation apparently thinks it’s a good idea to use artificial intelligence to draft rules impacting the safety of airplanes, cars, and pipelines, a ProPublica investigationrevealedMonday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be a problem if DOT becomes the first agency to use AI to draft rules, ProPublica pointed out, since AI is known to confidently get things wrong and hallucinate fabricated information. Staffers fear that any failure to catch AI errors could result in flawed laws, leading to lawsuits, injuries, or even deaths in the transportation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the DOT’s top lawyer, Gregory Zerzan, isn’t worried about that, December meeting notes revealed, because the point isn’t for AI to be perfect. It’s for AI to help speed up the rulemaking process, so that rules that take weeks or months to draft can instead be written within 30 days. According to Zerzan, DOT’s preferred tool, Google Gemini, can draft rules in under 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t need the perfect rule on XYZ,” Zerzan told DOT staffers at the meeting. “We don’t even need a very good rule on XYZ. We want good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProPublica spoke to experts and granted six DOT staffers anonymity to discuss their concerns about DOT’s use of Google Gemini to draft rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experts who monitor AI use in government told ProPublica that DOT could save time using Gemini as a research assistant “with plenty of supervision and transparency.” For example, at a presentation, DOT staffers were told that “most of what goes into the preambles of DOT regulatory documents is just ‘word salad,’” and “Gemini can do word salad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, staffers told ProPublica they felt “deeply skeptical” that Gemini was up to the task. They emphasized that DOT rulemaking is “intricate work” requiring sometimes decades of “expertise in the subject at hand as well as in existing statutes, regulations, and case law.” Likely unsettling staffers further, ProPublica noted that a demonstration of Gemini’s rule-drafting produced a document missing key text, which a staffer would then have to fill in. Additionally, the DOT’s move comes after a year of AI hallucinations scrambling courts, withmany lawyers finedand evenjudges admitting they can be fooledby fabricated information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any errors in the rules could have serious consequences. These rules “touch virtually every facet of transportation safety,” keeping “airplanes in the sky,” preventing “gas pipelines from exploding,” and stopping “freight trains carrying toxic chemicals from skidding off the rails,” ProPublica reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems wildly irresponsible,” one staffer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite staffers’ concerns, DOT appears to be racing forward with the plan, ProPublica reported. The department has already used Gemini to draft a “still-unpublished Federal Aviation Administration rule, according to a DOT staffer briefed on the matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has urged federal agencies to adopt AI at a rapid pace, but nowhere in his orders has the president pushed for AI to draft laws, ProPublica noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Trump is “very excited” about the DOT initiative, Zerzan told staffers at the meeting, suggesting that Trump sees DOT as the “point of the spear” and expects other agencies to follow its lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At DOT, Trump likely hopes to see many rules quickly updated to modernize airways and roadways. In areporthighlighting the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s biggest “wins” in 2025, the White House credited DOT with “replacing decades-old rules with flexible, innovation-friendly frameworks,” including fast-tracking rules to allow for more automated vehicles on the roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, DOT expects that Gemini can be relied on to “handle 80 to 90 percent of the work of writing regulations,” ProPublica reported. Eventually all federal workers who rely on AI tools like Gemini to draft rules “would fall back into merely an oversight role, monitoring ‘AI-to-AI interactions,’” ProPublica reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google did not respond to Ars’ request to comment on this use case for Gemini, which could spread across government under Trump’s direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the tech giant posted ablogon Monday, pitching Gemini for government more broadly, promising federal workers that AI would help with “creative problem-solving to the most critical aspects of their work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has been competing with AI rivals for government contracts,undercuttingOpenAI and Anthropic’s $1 deals by offering a year of access to Gemini for $0.47.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOT contract seems important to Google. In a Decemberblog, the company celebrated that DOT was “the first cabinet-level agency to fully transition its workforce away from legacy providers to Google Workspace with Gemini.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, Google suggested this move would help DOT “ensure the United States has the safest, most efficient, and modern transportation system in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, Google encouraged other federal leaders to launch their own efforts using Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are committed to supporting the DOT’s digital transformation and stand ready to help other federal leaders across the government adopt this blueprint for their own mission successes,” Google’s blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOT did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AirTag-2-1152x648.png" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first major upgrade since Apple introduced AirTags five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is introducing a new version of its AirTag tracking device—simply dubbed “the new AirTag"—and claims it offers substantial improvements thanks to a new Bluetooth chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original AirTag came out five years ago now, and it became popular in a variety of contexts. There were some problems, though—there was real concern about unwanted tracking and stalking with the devices, based on real stories of it being used for that. The company gradually introduced new features and protections against that, getting it to a much better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new version is focused on making the device more effective in general. Thanks to the inclusion of the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip (the same one found in other recently released Apple devices like the iPhone 17), Apple says the new AirTag can work with the Precision Finding feature in the Find My app to direct users to the AirTag (and whatever lost item it’s stored with or attached to) from up to 50 percent farther away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the speaker in the AirTag is now 50 percent louder, Apple says. These two things together address some user complaints that, as useful as an AirTag can be in ideal circumstances, sometimes it is frustrating trying to get things just right to find something. It won’t eliminate all edge cases, but it ought to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple used this announcement to also talk up some of the features of the AirTag, including the encryption that it says prevents anyone but the AirTag owner from using it, and an arrangement with airlines where users can temporarily give airlines the ability to use Apple’s network to find a specific AirTag to locate lost luggage and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, the new AirTag doesn’t introduce any major new features that aren’t already offered in the previous generation—this is just an update to the device’s accuracy, volume, and range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price remains unchanged, at $29 for one AirTag or $99 for a pack of four. The new model is available for order on Apple’s website now and will hit physical stores later this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/error-message-1000x648.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company’s autodiscover caused users’ test credentials to be sent outside Microsoft networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Department of Bizarre Anomalies: Microsoft has suppressed an unexplained anomaly on its network that was routing traffic destined to example.com—a domain reserved for testing purposes—to a maker of electronics cables located in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under theRFC2606—an official standard maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force—example.com isn’t obtainable by any party. Instead it resolves to IP addresses assigned to Internet Assiged Names Authority. The designation is intended to prevent third parties from being bombarded with traffic when developers, penetration testers, and others need a domain for testing or discussing technical issues. Instead of naming an Internet-routable domain, they are to choose example.com or two others, example.net and example.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output from the terminal command cURL shows that devices inside Azure and other Microsoft networks have been routing some traffic to subdomains of sei.co.jp, a domain belonging to Sumitomo Electric. Most of the resulting text is exactly what’s expected. The exception is the JSON-based response. Here’s the JSON output from Friday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, results when adding a new account for test@example.com in Outlook looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the results show that Microsoft was routing email traffic to two sei.co.jp subdomains: imapgms.jnet.sei.co.jp and smtpgms.jnet.sei.co.jp. The behavior was the result of Microsoft’sautodiscoverservice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m admittedly not an expert in Microsoft’s internal workings, but this appears to be a simple misconfiguration,”Michael Taggart, a senior cybersecurity researcher at UCLA Health, said. “The result is that anyone who tries to set up an Outlook account on an example.com domain might accidentally send test credentials to those sei.co.jp subdomains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked early Friday afternoon why Microsoft was doing this, a representative had no answer and asked for more time. By Monday morning, the improper routing was no longer occurring, but the representative still had no answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update:in an email sent after this post went live, the representative confirmed that Microsoft has “updated the service to no longer provide suggested server information for example.com.” As already reported here, the behavior only affected people configuring email accounts through the Outlook autoconfiguration feature. The representative added that Microsoft is investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new JSON response suggested that, as of Monday morning, Microsoft hadn’t fixed the endpoint routing traffic to the Sumitomo Electric servers. Instead, the JSON response no longer occurs. Where the output was occurring on Friday, the command now simply sits and hangs for 10 or 20 seconds and then terminates with a not found error. This behavior can be seen in the following output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks like they may have outright removed the endpoint that validates the email, because I’m seeing ‘not found’ errors,” saidDan Tentler, founder of Phobos Group. As denoted by ENOTFOUND, the error “suggests that [Microsoft admins] just ripped out whatever this thing was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how Sumitomo Electric’s domain would have found itself part of this mess. Microsoft last yearsaidthe Japanese company’s parent company, Sumitomo Corp., was deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot, but that still doesn’t explain why a subsidiary’s domain was added to Microsoft’s network configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions sent to Microsoft include: How are autodiscover records added at Microsoft; was the routing intentional; and how long has the behavior been occurring? (Tinyapps.org, whichnotedthe odd routing behavior earlier this month, said it lasted five years.) There doesn’t appear to be anything nefarious about the improper routing, and as long as people inside Microsoft’s network weren’t sending live credentials in tests, there was no danger posed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s still reason for concern. In 2024, Microsoft revealed that one of its admins had assigned administrative privileges to a test account on the company network and then forgot about it. Russia-state hackersseized on the gaffeto gain initial access to Microsoft’s system. They went on to root through the network and monitor top executives’ email for two months. The routing misconfiguration for example.com raises the question: What other possibly more severe errors lurk on the network?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2235571142-1152x648.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk Milhoan’s comments come as federal vaccine policy slides to insignificance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chair of a federal vaccine advisory panel under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made his stance clear on vaccines in a podcast last week—and that stance was so alarming that the American Medical Association was compelled to respond with a scathing statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk Milhoan, who wasnamed chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practicesfor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in December, appeared on the aptly named podcast “Why Should I Trust You.” In the hour-long interview, Milhoan made a wide range of comments that have concerned medical experts and raised eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early into the discussion, Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist, declared, “I don’t like established science,” and that “science is what I observe.” He lambasted the evidence-based methodology that previous ACIP panels used to carefully and transparently craft vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While arguing that he was not anti-vaccine, he said he was merely focused on safety and made false claims about vaccine risks, a common trope among anti-vaccine activists. He falsely linked vaccines to allergies, asthma, and eczema and repeated a claim, without evidence, that COVID-19 vaccines killed children. When pressed by the podcast hosts, he revealed that he put the risk of vaccine side effects on the same footing as the risks from the diseases the shots prevent—despite the fact that disease risks are often orders of magnitude larger than the tiny risks from vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to pushback from the hosts, Milhoan objected to the idea that the measles and polio vaccines reduced the spread of those diseases. He went further, questioning the need for those vaccines as well as routine vaccinations, generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think also as you look at polio, we need to not be afraid to consider that we are in a different time now than we were then,” he said, referring to the time before the first polio vaccines were developed in the 1950s. “Our sanitation is different. Our risk of disease is different. And so those all play into the evaluation of whether this is worthwhile of taking a risk for a vaccine or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then pondered out loud what would happen if people stopped getting vaccinated. “If we take away all of the herd immunity, then does that switch, does that teeter-totter switch in a different direction?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, AMA Trustee Sandra Adamson Fryhofer blasted the question. “This is not a theoretical debate—it is a dangerous step backward,” she said. “Vaccines have saved millions of lives and virtually eliminated devastating diseases like polio in the United States. There is no cure for polio. When vaccination rates fall, paralysis, lifelong disability, and death return. The science on this is settled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fryhofer also took aim at Milhoan’s repeated argument that the focus of vaccination policy should move from population-level health to individual autonomy. Moving away from routine immunizations, which include discussions between clinicians and patients, “does not increase freedom—it increases suffering,” she said, adding that the weakening of recommendations “will cost lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Milhoan’s comments only further erode the relevance of ACIP and federal vaccine policy among the medical community and states. According toa KFF policy brief, 27 states and Washington, DC, have already announced they will not follow current CDC vaccine recommendations, whichKennedy dramatically overhauledearlier this month without even consulting the ACIP. Instead, the majority of states are relying on previous recommendations or recommendations made within states or by medical organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatricsannounced the 2026 updateto itschildhood and adolescent vaccine schedule, which it has held up as an alternative to the CDC’s schedule and has been widely embraced by pediatricians. In the announcement, AAP noted that 12 other medical organizations have endorsed the schedule, including the AMA, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAP’s updated recommendations are largely the same as the schedule from last year, but it is significantly different from the CDC’s recommendations, which “depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children,” the AAP said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,” AAP President Andrew Racine said in the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unusually detailed post explains how OpenAI handles the Codex agent loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, OpenAI engineer Michael Bolinpublisheda detailed technical breakdown of how the company’sCodex CLIcoding agent works internally, offering developers insight into AI coding tools that can write code, run tests, and fix bugs with human supervision. It complements our articlein Decemberon how AI agents work by filling in technical details on how OpenAI implements its “agentic loop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI coding agents are having something of a “ChatGPT moment,” where Claude Code with Opus 4.5 and Codex with GPT-5.2 have reached a new level of usefulness for rapidly coding up prototypes, interfaces, and churning out boilerplate code. The timing of OpenAI’s post details the design philosophy behind Codex just as AI agents are becoming more practical tools for everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools aren’t perfect and remain controversial for some software developers. While OpenAI haspreviously toldArs Technica that it uses Codex as a coding tool to help develop the Codex product itself, we alsodiscovered, through hands-on experience, that these tools can be astonishingly fast at simple tasks but remain brittle beyond their training data and require human oversight for production work. The rough framework of a project tends to come fast and feels magical, but filling in the details involves tedious debugging and workarounds for limitations the agent cannot overcome on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolin’s post doesn’t shy away from these engineering challenges. He discusses the inefficiency of quadratic prompt growth, performance issues caused by cache misses, and bugs the team discovered (likeMCP toolsbeing enumerated inconsistently) that they had to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of technical detail is somewhat unusual for OpenAI, which has not published similar breakdowns of how other products like ChatGPT work internally, for example (there’s a lot going on under that hood we’d like to know). But we’ve already seen how OpenAI treats Codex differently during our interview with them in December, noting that programming tasks seem ideally suited for large language models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that bothOpenAIandAnthropicopen-source their coding CLI clients on GitHub, allowing developers to examine the implementation directly, whereas they don’t do the same for ChatGPT or the Claude web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolin’s post focuses on what he calls “the agent loop,” which is the core logic that orchestrates interactions between the user, the AI model, and the software tools the model invokes to perform coding work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As wewrotein December, at the center of every AI agent is a repeating cycle. The agent takes input from the user and prepares a textual prompt for the model. The model then generates a response, which either produces a final answer for the user or requests a tool call (such as running a shell command or reading a file). If the model requests a tool call, the agent executes it, appends the output to the original prompt, and queries the model again. This process repeats until the model stops requesting tools and instead produces an assistant message for the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looping process has to start somewhere, and Bolin’s post reveals how Codex constructs the initial prompt sent to OpenAI’s Responses API, which handles model inference. The prompt is built from several components, each with an assigned role that determines its priority: system, developer, user, or assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructions field comes from either a user-specified configuration file or base instructions bundled with the CLI. The tools field defines what functions the model can call, including shell commands, planning tools, web search capabilities, and any custom tools provided through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The input field contains a series of items that describe the sandbox permissions, optional developer instructions, environment context like the current working directory, and finally the user’s actual message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As conversations continue, each new turn includes the complete history of previous messages and tool calls. This means the prompt grows with every interaction, which has performance implications. According to the post, because Codex does not use an optional “previous_response_id” parameter that would allow the API to reference stored conversation state, every request is fully stateless (that is, it sends the entire conversation history with each API call rather than the server retrieving it from memory). Bolin says this design choice simplifies things for API providers and makes it easier to support customers who opt into “Zero Data Retention,” where OpenAI does not store user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thequadratic growthof prompts over a conversation is inefficient, but Bolin explains that prompt caching mitigates this issue somewhat. Cache hits only work for exact prefix matches within a prompt, which means Codex must carefully avoid operations that could cause cache misses. Changing the available tools, switching models, or modifying the sandbox configuration mid-conversation can all invalidate the cache and hurt performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ever-growing prompt length is directly related to the context window, which limits how much text the AI model can process in a single inference call. Bolin writes that Codex automatically compacts conversations when token counts exceed a threshold, just as Claude Code does. Earlier versions of Codex required manual compaction via a slash command, but the current system uses a specialized API endpoint that compresses context while preserving summarized portions of the model’s “understanding” of what happened through an encrypted content item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolin says that future posts in his series will cover the CLI’s architecture, tool implementation details, and Codex’s sandboxing model.&lt;/p&gt;
