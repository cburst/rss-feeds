&lt;p&gt;Supernatural has had its staff cut and won’t receive any more content updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tencia Benavidez, a Supernatural user who lives in New Mexico, started her VR workouts during the Covid pandemic. She has been a regular user in the five years since, calling the ability to work out in VR ideal, given that she lives in a rural area where it’s hard to get to a gym or work out outside during a brutal winter. She stuck with Supernatural because of the community and the eagerness of Supernatural’s coaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They seem like really authentic individuals that were not talking down to you,” Benavidez says. “There’s just something really special about those coaches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta bought Supernatural in 2022, folding it into its then-heavily-invested-in metaverse efforts. The purchase was not a smooth process, as it triggered a lengthy legal battle in which the US Federal Trade Commissiontried to block Metafrom purchasing the service due to antitrust concerns about Meta “trying to buy its way to the top” of the VR market. Meta ultimately prevailed. At the time, some Supernatural users were cautiously optimistic, hoping that big bag of Zuckerbucks could keep its workout juggernaut afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Meta fought the government to buy this thing,” Benavidez says. “All that just for them to shut it down? What was the point?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to Meta and Supernatural, and neither responded to my requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday,Bloomberg reportedthat Meta has laid off more than 1,000 people across its VR and metaverse efforts. The move comes after years of the company hemorrhagingbillionsofdollarson its metaverse products. In addition to laying off most of the staff at Supernatural, Meta has shut down three internal VR studios that made games likeResident Evil 4andDeadpool VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If it was a bottom-line thing, I think they could have charged more money,” Goff Johnson says about Supernatural. “I think people would have paid for it. This just seems unnecessarily heartless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a split in the community about who will stay and continue to pay the subscription fee and who will leave. Supernatural has more than 3,000 lessons available in the service, so while new content won’t be added, some feel there is plenty of content left in the library. Other users worry about how Supernatural will continue to license music from big-name bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Supernatural is amazing, but I am canceling it because of this,” Chip told me. “The library is large, so there’s enough to keep you busy, but not for the same price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other VR workout experiences likeFitXRor even the VR stapleBeat Saber, which Supernatural cribs a lot of design concepts from. Still, they don’t hit the same bar for many of the Supernatural faithful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to stick it out until they turn the lights out on us,” says Stefanie Wong, a Bay Area accountant who has used Supernatural since shortly after the pandemic and has organized and attended meetup events. “It’s not the app. It’s the community, and it’s the coaches that we really, really care about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried out Supernatural’s Together feature on Wednesday, the day after the layoffs. It’s where I met Chip and Alisa. When we could stop to catch our breath, we talked about the changes coming to the service. They had played through previous sessions hosted by Jane Fonda or playlists with a mix of music that would change regularly. This one was an artist series featuring entirely Imagine Dragons songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the session, as we punched blocks while being serenaded by thisshirtless dude crooning, recorded narrations from Supernatural coach Dwana Olsen chimed in to hype us up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Take advantage of these moments,” Olsen said as we punched away. “Use these movements to remind you of how much awesome life you have yet to live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, it was downright invigorating. And bittersweet. We ended another round, sweaty, huffing and puffing. Chip, Alisa, and I high-fived like crazy and readied for another round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beautiful,” Alisa said. “It’s just beautiful, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;
