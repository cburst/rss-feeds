&lt;p&gt;Museums, theaters and concert halls from Texas to Massachusetts shut their doors on Sunday as a powerful winter storm marched eastward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least five of New York’s largest museums were closed on Sunday, when the brunt of the storm was expected to hit the region, including the Frick Collection, the Guggenheim, the Whitney, the Brooklyn Museum and the Studio Museum in Harlem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the American Museum of Natural History remained open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sunday morning, two Broadways shows in New York — “Aladdin” and “The Lion King” — had paused performances until Tuesday. And while a handful of Off Broadway shows, including “Heathers: The Musical,” “The Monsters” and “Anna Christie,” also canceled shows, the Broadway League, which represents theater owners, producers and other professionals, said on Saturday that most productions would continue as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Philharmonic rescheduled a show conducted by Gustavo Dudamel at Radio City Music Hall for Tuesday, and the Beacon Theater rescheduled a performance by the comedians Seth Meyers and John Oliver for next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Texas, where tens of thousands of customers had lost power, officials at the Dallas Museum of Art said their institution would be closed for the entire weekend. Similar announcements were made by the Mint Museum Randolph in Charlotte, N.C.; the Columbia Museum of Art in South Carolina; the Carnegie museums in Pittsburgh; and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smithsonian, which has locations in Washington and New York, said all of its museums, research centers and the National Zoo would be closed on Sunday and Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the Field Museum in Chicago closed because of extreme cold.&lt;/p&gt;

President Trump has found that putting out a story line early and repeating it often can convince a sizable share of the public that does not credit contrary evidence.

Minnesota officials said they aimed to have their Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which typically takes the lead in police shootings, work the investigation, either concurrently or in partnership with the federal government.

&lt;p&gt;Across social media, pro-Trump influencers and others muddled the evidence of the killing of a nurse in Minneapolis on Saturday with social media posts that included misdirection and fabricated content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While verified videos and witnesses showed how federal immigration agents tackled and shot Alex Pretti, 37, the posts tried to warp the events, including in ways intended to support the Trump administration’s claims that Mr. Pretti was at fault for his own death. Some posts smeared him or portrayed him as a radical activist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Sortor, a pro-Trump influencer with 1.4 million followers on X, incorrectly identified Mr. Pretti, a U.S. citizen, as an unauthorized immigrant. Jack Posobiec, a Trump loyalist with 3.3 million followers on X, falsely described Mr. Pretti as having “run up on police” and drawn a gun — claims that other users on X corrected in an appended note. Photos of different men — dressed in drag or shirtless at a street festival — were wrongly identified as Mr. Pretti and shared widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Posobiec, Mr. Sortor and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chaotic scene was captured on video from several angles, yet that shaky footage added to debate online, where it was rapidly interpreted and scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authenticated footage shows Mr. Pretti, who had no known criminal record and had a permit to carry a concealed firearm, stepping in front of a woman being pepper-sprayed by an agent before being restrained himself. One agent removed Mr. Pretti’s pistol, which he had not drawn, and then another shot him repeatedly in the back. Witnesses corroborated the details in the videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flurry of online activity echoed the broader political narratives that emerged after the shooting. Top Trump administration officials have repeatedly lodged unsubstantiated accusations of domestic terrorism against Mr. Pretti, who was pinned down and had been disarmed when agents opened fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some conservative accounts pushed back against the Trump administration’s narrative. Responding to the Trump administration’s suggestion that Mr. Pretti wanted to “massacre” law enforcement, Tim Pool, a right-wing podcaster, wrote on X that Mr. Pretti “clearly was not intending to massacre ICE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, many social media users repeated the Trump administration’s representation of events. Others posted images of the scene misleadingly altered with artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One image, for example, was edited to depict Mr. Pretti pointing a gun at an agent, though he was actually holding a phone. Another was altered with Gemini, Google’s A.I. tool, supposedly to enhance and sharpen it to reveal key details about the scene. The altered image included obvious errors, including changes to Mr. Pretti’s face. It also removed a gun from the agent’s hand, fueling more debate on social media over what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A widely circulated image on social media was edited using A.I., introducing errors and other changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/multimedia/25dc-response-ltpb/25dc-response-ltpb-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after federal agents shot and killed a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident on Saturday, senior members of the Trump administration were ready with their conclusions about what had happened and who was to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Miller, President Trump’s homeland security adviser, called the victim, Alex Pretti, who was filming Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis, a “domestic terrorist.” Gregory Bovino, the official in charge of Border Patrol operations, said Mr. Pretti was out to “massacre law enforcement.” The Department of Homeland Security said an agent had fired “defensive shots” because he was “fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as videos emerged that contradicted the government’s account, the Trump administration was in a race to control the narrative around the killing of Mr. Pretti, a registered nurse with no criminal record who was pinned down when immigration agents opened fire and killed him. The rush to blame Mr. Pretti and exonerate the immigration agents — even while officials were still gathering the facts — deviates entirely from the way law enforcement investigations are normally carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also underscores what has become a pattern by Mr. Trump and top administration officials to justify an increasingly violent crackdown: immediately going on the offensive and demonizing the victim, often distorting the facts in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Mr. Trump said Democrats were to blame for the killings, not federal agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His reasoning, which he laid out on social media, was that Democrats were not cooperating with the ICE operation in Minneapolis, which has created “dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Altman, a former Customs and Border Protection official who served in the Trump and Biden administrations, said presidents often tried to find political advantage in moments of crisis. But he said it undermined public confidence in the investigation process to make snap judgments about motive and blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Altman, who oversaw internal investigations into use of force, said there were well-established procedures for such cases, including timelines for notifying Congress and the public. “Those measures are designed to promote transparency and accountability,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Mr. Pretti was shot, officials at D.H.S. and the White House were in contact about how to respond to the incident, according to a person familiar with the communications who asked for anonymity to describe internal procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The officials sought information from the ground in Minneapolis and worked with lawyers to prepare the statement issued by D.H.S. Some details were removed before the statement was published because they were still working to get a more complete picture of what happened, the person familiar with the process said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the statement claimed that Mr. Pretti “approached” officers with handgun and the “armed suspect violently resisted” when officials tried to disarm him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos of the encounter show Mr. Pretti, who had a permit to carry a firearm, stepping between a woman and an agent who was pepper spraying her. Mr. Pretti is then hit with pepper spray before a group of agents pile on to him, restraining and disarming him before the barrage of gunfire. Videos show that he never drew his weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, labeled Mr. Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” saying that was just “the facts” of the case and claiming to know his motive: “to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day D.H.S. issued its statement, Mr. Miller and Mr. Bovino, the key architects of Mr. Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown, showed little restraint. Their social media posts are not subject to review, and their public comments are rarely carefully worded. In November, a federal judge found that Mr. Bovino had lied multiple times about federal agents’ use of force during immigration enforcement operations in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The killing of Mr. Pretti — and the administration’s handling of the case — has drawn criticism from across the political spectrum. Democrats assailed the Trump administration and quickly signaled that they would oppose legislation to fund large parts of the government because it included $10 billion for ICE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major gun rights activists and groups, typically allies of Mr. Trump’s, also denounced his administration for suggesting that Mr. Pretti’s killing might have be justified because he was carrying a pistol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Essayli, a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, wrote on social media, “If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you.” Gun Owners of America, one of the country’s largest gun advocacy groups, said in a post on social media that it condemned Mr. Essayli’s “untoward comments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Republicans in Congress also raised concerns about the shooting, a reflection of fears within the party of how backlash to the administration’s aggressive tactics could damage their political prospects in the midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The credibility of ICE and D.H.S. are at stake,” said Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, who also called for a “full joint federal and state investigation” into Mr. Pretti’s death. “We can trust the American people with the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poll from The New York Times and Siena University, conducted after the killing of Renee Good, the 37-year-old woman who was shot in Minneapolis by an ICE officer this month, found that roughly half of voters supported Mr. Trump’s deportations and his handling of the border with Mexico, but a sizable majority believed that ICE had gone too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just 36 percent of voters said they approved of the way ICE was handling its job, according to the poll, while 63 percent disapproved — including 70 percent of independent voters. And 61 percent of voters said ICE had “gone too far” in their tactics, including nearly one in five Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sunday morning, even some senior Trump administration officials appeared to try to tone down some of the language. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, dodged questions on NBC’s “Meet the Press” about whether Mr. Pretti was “brandishing a gun,” as Ms. Noem had said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do not know, and nobody else knows, either,” Mr. Blanche said. “That’s why we’re doing an investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Bovino gave little ground in an interview on CNN, arguing that the border patrol agents were the “victims” and that Mr. Pretti had “injected himself into that law enforcement situation with a weapon.” Still, when pressed for evidence, Mr. Bovino had little to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The facts are going to come to light as to what exactly happened with an investigation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

President Trump said on social media on Sunday that the blame for recent unrest lay, in part, with “Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States.”

&lt;p&gt;President Trump said in a series of social media posts on Sunday that two American citizens had “tragically” lost their lives amid his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, but he blamed Democratic leaders for the deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to cooperate with ICE, and they are actually encouraging Leftwing Agitators to unlawfully obstruct their operations to arrest the Worst of the Worst People!” he wrote. “By doing this, Democrats are putting Illegal Alien Criminals over Taxpaying, Law-Abiding Citizens, and they have created dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posts apparently referred to the deaths this month of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, two U.S. citizens and Minneapolis residents who were shot and killed by federal immigration agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top Trump administration officials immediately and without evidence accused each of the shooting victims of “domestic terrorism” and said they were seeking to harm federal agents. In both cases, video footage from the scene contradicted the Trump administration’s version of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump, in the posts, also called on officials in Democratic-led cities and states to work with immigration authorities by turning over undocumented immigrants who are in state prisons and local jails, and said that Congress should pass legislation to “END Sanctuary Cities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He drew a contrast with Republican-led states, including Texas, Florida and Louisiana, where he said that immigration operations had not been met with the same level of opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The killing of Mr. Pretti on Saturday has prompted a growing number of Republicans to express concerns about what happened and to call for an independent investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Pretti had been legally carrying a gun but was disarmed and pinned on the ground when he was shot, according to videos. Gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, have also pushed back on claims by federal officials that Mr. Pretti did not have a Second Amendment right to carry a firearm simply because he was protesting or observing federal agents’ actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on Sunday, Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal that his administration was “reviewing everything” about Mr. Pretti’s death, and that agents would leave the city “at some point,” although he did not give a time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane, a Bombardier Challenger 600, crashed as it was taking off from the airport at around 7:45 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether there were any fatalities or injuries among the eight people that the F.A.A. reported were on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F.A.A. and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate, the F.A.A. said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airport remained closed on Sunday as emergency crews responded to the crash, Aimee Thibodeau, a spokeswoman for Bangor International Airport, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement did not provide details about the crash, but residents were advised to stay away from the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are unable to provide any additional information at this time,” Ms. Thibodeau said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major winter storm was pummeling the eastern United States on Sunday, forcing the cancellation of thousands of flights nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a developing story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend’s gigantic snowstorm dumped a foot or more of snow in at least 17 states from New Mexico to New Hampshire, according to preliminary figures from the National Weather Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonito Lake, N.M., received 31 inches, the most in the United States this weekend, the agency said. East of the Mississippi, the highest totals were recorded in western Pennsylvania, where 20 inches had fallen near Clintonville, about 60 miles north of Pittsburgh, as of 8:30 p.m. Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures are a mix of unofficial and official measurements and are subject to verification, the Weather Service said. As of Sunday night, these were the highest totals in the other 15 states that received at least a foot of snow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crested Butte, Colo.: 23 inches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/25/multimedia/25winter-storm-mississippi-jbth/25winter-storm-mississippi-jbth-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freezing rain from a severe winter storm led to tens of thousands of power outages in a Mississippi county over the weekend, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20,000 out of about 35,000 homes in Lafayette County had no power on Sunday night as a result of an ice storm and high winds, said Beau Moore, an emergency management officer there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area around Oxford, Miss., was especially hard hit. The National Weather Service received reports of nearly an inch of accumulated ice after freezing rain hit that area late Saturday, said Phil Baker, a meteorologist in the agency’s Memphis office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Robyn Tannehill of Oxford said in an update posted to social media said that trees had fallen under the weight of ice and that power lines were down across the city of 26,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things went downhill quickly,” Mr. Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperatures were expected to drop to 7 degrees Fahrenheit overnight, he added, and the main concern was the safety of people dealing with the cold without power. Officials opened warming centers to accommodate as many residents without heat as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheriff Joey East of Lafayette County said in a text message on Sunday night that conditions were “probably worse or as bad” as they were after a 1994 storm that left some in the region without power for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi said at a news conference that approximately 47 counties in the state had been impacted by the storm. State officials had requested generators and other supplies from the Federal Emergency Management Agency under a federal emergency declaration for the state signed by President Trump, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The weather is probably going to get worse before it gets better,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 150,000 electricity customers across Mississippi had no power as of early Monday morning, according to the site poweroutage.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Mississippi, which is in Oxford, will be closed on Monday and Tuesday, and local public school districts will be closed all week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Moore said that Lafayette County expected to see more downed trees, and that this could take down additional power lines. The county has hired private companies to help clear the roads, but he estimated that power outages would continue for at least another 48 hours. It could be another week before the county’s main roads are safe enough for travel.&lt;/p&gt;
