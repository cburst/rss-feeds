&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/multimedia/24minneapolis-ice-swornstatements/24minneapolis-ice-swornstatements-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doctor who lives near the scene where Alex Jeffrey Pretti was shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday described in a sworn court filing how agents initially hesitated and asked for proof of a medical license when the doctor tried to approach and render aid. And a person who said they were standing near Mr. Pretti disputed the Department of Homeland Security’s account of that incident in another sworn court filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shooting of Mr. Pretti, 37, renewed protests and clashes with law enforcement in a city where tensions over aggressive federal immigration action are high. Video footage of the encounter appeared to contradict parts of the federal government’s narrative of what happened, and the latest court filings raised further questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor, whose name was redacted from the publicly available version of the court filing, described themselves as a pediatrician and said they had witnessed parts of the encounter from a nearby apartment. Though their view was from a distance, they described seeing a man being shoved to the ground and then shot several times. After the gunfire, they described going outside, telling an agent that they were a physician and asking to check the person who had been shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor said they were initially turned down, but eventually allowed to go to the person after being patted down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Normally, I would not have been so persistent,” the doctor said in their statement, “but as a physician, I felt a professional and moral obligation to help this man, especially since none of the agents were helping him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor described checking for a pulse, finding none, and then beginning C.P.R. The man appeared to have been shot several times, the doctor said. Shortly after he started C.P.R., emergency medical personnel arrived and took over, the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the shooting, the doctor described returning home as protests intensified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was sobbing and shaking uncontrollably,” they said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once tear gas began seeping into their apartment from the street below, they said they got in a car and drove to a friend’s home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am not sure when I will return to my apartment,” the doctor wrote. “I do not feel safe in my city.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately after agents shot Mr. Pretti on Saturday morning, federal officials claimed that he had endangered agents with a gun he was carrying, and some later accused him of “domestic terrorism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But videos on social media that were verified by The New York Times appear to contradict portions of the Department of Homeland Security’s account of the shooting, and the Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, said that Mr. Pretti was believed to be licensed to legally carry a gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another person who said they witnessed the shooting also submitted a sworn statement in court on Saturday. Like the doctor’s statement, it was filed as part of a lawsuit challenging federal agents’ interactions with protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have read the statement from D.H.S. about what happened and it is wrong,” said that person, who described themselves as a children’s entertainer specializing in face painting. “The man did not approach the agents with a gun. He approached them with a camera. He was just trying to help a woman get up and they took him to the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That witness described hearing whistles — which Minneapolis residents have used to alert people to the presence of immigration agents — and going toward the noise to observe and record on Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person said they walked toward an area where someone was being thrown to the ground and then started filming. When an agent asked them to move back, the witness said, they slowly did so. Another man who was in the street and who was also recording remained there and continued filming, the witness said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The man stayed in the street, filming as the other observers I mentioned earlier were being forced backward by another ICE agent threatening them with pepper spray,” the witness statement said. “The man went closer to support them as they got threatened, just with his camera out. I didn’t see him reach for or hold a gun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person was thrown to the ground by an agent, the witness said, and pepper spray was used. The man who had been filming — almost certainly Mr. Pretti, though no name was used in the court filing — tried to help the person who had fallen, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The agents pulled the man on the ground,” the statement said, adding that the witness was perhaps five feet away. “I didn’t see him touch any of them — he wasn’t even turned toward them. It didn’t look like he was trying to resist, just trying to help the woman up. I didn’t see him with a gun. They threw him to the ground. Four or five agents had him on the ground and they just started shooting him. They shot him so many times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court filing said that a video taken by the witness was also filed with the court, but that footage was not immediately accessible through an online court records system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the witness statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those sworn statements were filed as part of a lawsuit backed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota that accused federal agents of repeatedly violating protesters’ rights during a recent surge of immigration enforcement. The federal judge hearing that case issued an injunction earlier this month that imposed restrictions on agents. The Trump administration appealed, and an appellate court issued an administrative stay this week that blocked the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, lawyers for the protesters filed an emergency motion that asked the appellate court to allow the injunction to go back into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

Snow began to accumulate in Queens on Sunday morning. Mayor Zohran Mamdani had said last week that he would not call for a snow day in city schools.

Senator Cassidy Calls for Investigation of Fatal Minnesota Shooting</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/25/us/bill-cassidy-minneapolis-investigation.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/multimedia/25minneapolis-ice-cassidy-qvtf/25minneapolis-ice-cassidy-qvtf-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who is facing a primary challenger backed by President Trump, called for a “full joint federal and state investigation” into the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis resident by federal agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cassidy on Saturday night became the most prominent congressional Republican to condemn what was unfolding in Minneapolis, in a statement that called the fatal shooting of Alex Jeffrey Pretti “incredibly disturbing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The credibility of ICE and D.H.S. are at stake,” Mr. Cassidy said. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is at odds with the approach of the Trump administration, which said the Department of Homeland Security would lead the investigation into the shooting and initially blocked Minnesota authorities from examining the scene of the shooting, according to a state official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Democrats in Congress have expressed outrage about the shooting and quickly said they could not support a spending deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security, most congressional Republicans, away from Washington for the weekend, have stayed quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cassidy’s comments were all the more striking because he is fighting for his political career amid accusations that he has been insufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump. The president has backed a primary challenger to Mr. Cassidy, who voted for an impeachment conviction of the president after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, has also called for an investigation into the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Andrew Garbarino of New York, the Republican chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement on Saturday night that he had requested testimony from the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Garbarino did not mention Minneapolis in his statement, but said: “I take my oversight duties for the department seriously, and Congress has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Museums, theaters and concert halls from Texas to Massachusetts shut their doors on Sunday as a powerful winter storm marched eastward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least five of New York’s largest museums were closed on Sunday, when the brunt of the storm was expected to hit the region, including the Frick Collection, the Guggenheim, the Whitney, the Brooklyn Museum and the Studio Museum in Harlem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the American Museum of Natural History remained open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sunday morning, two Broadways shows in New York — “Aladdin” and “The Lion King” — had paused performances until Tuesday. And while a handful of Off Broadway shows, including “Heathers: The Musical,” “The Monsters” and “Anna Christie,” also canceled shows, the Broadway League, which represents theater owners, producers and other professionals, said on Saturday that most productions would continue as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Philharmonic rescheduled a show conducted by Gustavo Dudamel at Radio City Music Hall for Tuesday, and the Beacon Theater rescheduled a performance by the comedians Seth Meyers and John Oliver for next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Texas, where tens of thousands of customers had lost power, officials at the Dallas Museum of Art said their institution would be closed for the entire weekend. Similar announcements were made by the Mint Museum Randolph in Charlotte, N.C.; the Columbia Museum of Art in South Carolina; the Carnegie museums in Pittsburgh; and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smithsonian, which has locations in Washington and New York, said all of its museums, research centers and the National Zoo would be closed on Sunday and Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the Field Museum in Chicago closed because of extreme cold.&lt;/p&gt;

President Trump has found that putting out a story line early and repeating it often can convince a sizable share of the public that does not credit contrary evidence.

&lt;p&gt;Across social media, pro-Trump influencers and others muddled the evidence of the killing of a nurse in Minneapolis on Saturday with social media posts that included misdirection and fabricated content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While verified videos and witnesses showed how federal immigration agents tackled and shot Alex Pretti, 37, the posts tried to warp the events, including in ways intended to support the Trump administration’s claims that Mr. Pretti was at fault for his own death. Some posts smeared him or portrayed him as a radical activist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Sortor, a pro-Trump influencer with 1.4 million followers on X, incorrectly identified Mr. Pretti, a U.S. citizen, as an unauthorized immigrant. Jack Posobiec, a Trump loyalist with 3.3 million followers on X, falsely described Mr. Pretti as having “run up on police” and drawn a gun — claims that other users on X corrected in an appended note. Photos of different men — dressed in drag or shirtless at a street festival — were wrongly identified as Mr. Pretti and shared widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Posobiec, Mr. Sortor and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chaotic scene was captured on video from several angles, yet that shaky footage added to debate online, where it was rapidly interpreted and scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authenticated footage shows Mr. Pretti, who had no known criminal record and had a permit to carry a concealed firearm, stepping in front of a woman being pepper-sprayed by an agent before being restrained himself. One agent removed Mr. Pretti’s pistol, which he had not drawn, and then another shot him repeatedly in the back. Witnesses corroborated the details in the videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flurry of online activity echoed the broader political narratives that emerged after the shooting. Top Trump administration officials have repeatedly lodged unsubstantiated accusations of domestic terrorism against Mr. Pretti, who was pinned down and had been disarmed when agents opened fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some conservative accounts pushed back against the Trump administration’s narrative. Responding to the Trump administration’s suggestion that Mr. Pretti wanted to “massacre” law enforcement, Tim Pool, a right-wing podcaster, wrote on X that Mr. Pretti “clearly was not intending to massacre ICE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, many social media users repeated the Trump administration’s representation of events. Others posted images of the scene misleadingly altered with artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One image, for example, was edited to depict Mr. Pretti pointing a gun at an agent, though he was actually holding a phone. Another was altered with Gemini, Google’s A.I. tool, supposedly to enhance and sharpen it to reveal key details about the scene. The altered image included obvious errors, including changes to Mr. Pretti’s face. It also removed a gun from the agent’s hand, fueling more debate on social media over what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A widely circulated image on social media was edited using A.I., introducing errors and other changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/multimedia/25dc-response-ltpb/25dc-response-ltpb-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after federal agents shot and killed a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident on Saturday, senior members of the Trump administration were ready with their conclusions about what had happened and who was to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Miller, President Trump’s homeland security adviser, called the victim, Alex Pretti, who was filming Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis, a “domestic terrorist.” Gregory Bovino, the official in charge of Border Patrol operations, said Mr. Pretti was out to “massacre law enforcement.” The Department of Homeland Security said an agent had fired “defensive shots” because he was “fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as videos emerged that contradicted the government’s account, the Trump administration was in a race to control the narrative around the killing of Mr. Pretti, a registered nurse with no criminal record who was pinned down when immigration agents opened fire and killed him. The rush to blame Mr. Pretti and exonerate the immigration agents — even while officials were still gathering the facts — deviates entirely from the way law enforcement investigations are normally carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also underscores what has become a pattern by Mr. Trump and top administration officials to justify an increasingly violent crackdown: immediately going on the offensive and demonizing the victim, often distorting the facts in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Mr. Trump said Democrats were to blame for the killings, not federal agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His reasoning, which he laid out on social media, was that Democrats were not cooperating with the ICE operation in Minneapolis, which has created “dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Altman, a former Customs and Border Protection official who served in the Trump and Biden administrations, said presidents often tried to find political advantage in moments of crisis. But he said it undermined public confidence in the investigation process to make snap judgments about motive and blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Altman, who oversaw internal investigations into use of force, said there were well-established procedures for such cases, including timelines for notifying Congress and the public. “Those measures are designed to promote transparency and accountability,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Mr. Pretti was shot, officials at D.H.S. and the White House were in contact about how to respond to the incident, according to a person familiar with the communications who asked for anonymity to describe internal procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The officials sought information from the ground in Minneapolis and worked with lawyers to prepare the statement issued by D.H.S. Some details were removed before the statement was published because they were still working to get a more complete picture of what happened, the person familiar with the process said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the statement claimed that Mr. Pretti “approached” officers with handgun and the “armed suspect violently resisted” when officials tried to disarm him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos of the encounter show Mr. Pretti, who had a permit to carry a firearm, stepping between a woman and an agent who was pepper spraying her. Mr. Pretti is then hit with pepper spray before a group of agents pile on to him, restraining and disarming him before the barrage of gunfire. Videos show that he never drew his weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, labeled Mr. Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” saying that was just “the facts” of the case and claiming to know his motive: “to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day D.H.S. issued its statement, Mr. Miller and Mr. Bovino, the key architects of Mr. Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown, showed little restraint. Their social media posts are not subject to review, and their public comments are rarely carefully worded. In November, a federal judge found that Mr. Bovino had lied multiple times about federal agents’ use of force during immigration enforcement operations in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The killing of Mr. Pretti — and the administration’s handling of the case — has drawn criticism from across the political spectrum. Democrats assailed the Trump administration and quickly signaled that they would oppose legislation to fund large parts of the government because it included $10 billion for ICE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major gun rights activists and groups, typically allies of Mr. Trump’s, also denounced his administration for suggesting that Mr. Pretti’s killing might have be justified because he was carrying a pistol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Essayli, a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, wrote on social media, “If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you.” Gun Owners of America, one of the country’s largest gun advocacy groups, said in a post on social media that it condemned Mr. Essayli’s “untoward comments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Republicans in Congress also raised concerns about the shooting, a reflection of fears within the party of how backlash to the administration’s aggressive tactics could damage their political prospects in the midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The credibility of ICE and D.H.S. are at stake,” said Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, who also called for a “full joint federal and state investigation” into Mr. Pretti’s death. “We can trust the American people with the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poll from The New York Times and Siena University, conducted after the killing of Renee Good, the 37-year-old woman who was shot in Minneapolis by an ICE officer this month, found that roughly half of voters supported Mr. Trump’s deportations and his handling of the border with Mexico, but a sizable majority believed that ICE had gone too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just 36 percent of voters said they approved of the way ICE was handling its job, according to the poll, while 63 percent disapproved — including 70 percent of independent voters. And 61 percent of voters said ICE had “gone too far” in their tactics, including nearly one in five Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sunday morning, even some senior Trump administration officials appeared to try to tone down some of the language. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, dodged questions on NBC’s “Meet the Press” about whether Mr. Pretti was “brandishing a gun,” as Ms. Noem had said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do not know, and nobody else knows, either,” Mr. Blanche said. “That’s why we’re doing an investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Bovino gave little ground in an interview on CNN, arguing that the border patrol agents were the “victims” and that Mr. Pretti had “injected himself into that law enforcement situation with a weapon.” Still, when pressed for evidence, Mr. Bovino had little to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The facts are going to come to light as to what exactly happened with an investigation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
