&lt;p&gt;After federal immigration agents shot and killed an American citizen in Minneapolis for the second time this month, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota that outlined what she described as three “simple steps” to “bring back law and order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her final step, however, seemed to have little to do with immigration or the state’s fraud scandal, the stated reasons for the federal government’s presence in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Third, allow the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to access voter rolls to confirm that Minnesota’s voter registration practices comply with federal law,” she wrote. Minnesota’s secretary of state, Steve Simon, a Democrat, swiftly rejected the demand, calling it an “outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. citizens in violation of state and federal law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Bondi’s request was part of a nearly yearlong fight in which the Trump administration has sought voters’ private data from states across the country. Numerous states, including Minnesota, have not complied, and the Justice Department has sued them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at what is happening and the concerns over privacy and elections that have arisen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly every state has a public version of its voter roll that includes basic information like first and last names. Some of these rolls include addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the complete, unredacted voter file includes personal identifying information, like driver’s license numbers and Social Security numbers. This list is kept private and is maintained by top election officials in each state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, no one can obtain it through public records requests — not even the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Bondi has said that the Trump administration is trying to keep elections secure. But President Trump and his allies — who tried to overturn the 2020 election and continue to deny its legitimacy — have long pushed unsubstantiated claims about undocumented immigrants voting illegally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last year, the Justice Department began to try to build the largest set of national voter roll data it has ever collected, raising concerns that the data could be used to cast doubt on future election results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it’s highly unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department has taken aggressive steps in the past to try to root out voter fraud, including during former President George W. Bush’s administration. But the idea of the federal government obtaining states’ private voter information was long seen as an overreach, because the Constitution dictates that elections are run mainly by individual states, not the administration in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 11, all of them at least partly run by Republicans, according to data from the Brennan Center for Justice, a voting rights and democracy group. Some other states, largely Republican-led ones, have provided their voter data to a separate but related program in the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But roughly half of the country’s states, most of them led by Democrats, have rejected the requests. The Justice Department has sued at least 24 states and territories, including Minnesota, to force them to turn over their voter data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some states, including Minnesota, have laws that prevent the transfer of private information. Others have expressed worries about how the Justice Department will keep the enormous troves of private information secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for many election officials and voting rights experts, the main concern is that the Justice Department’s effort is led by Trump allies who long falsely denied that former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These data can be manipulated to support false claims about ineligible voting and justify efforts to thwart free and fair elections,” Wendy Weiser, who directs the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, wrote on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota secretary of state, Mr. Simon, said this possibility was on his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Though I’m not necessarily predicting direct federal interference with elections, I am planning for it,” he said in an interview, “and it would be irresponsible to not do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is still being litigated, but some legal experts have pointed to the Constitution’s language that the “times, places and manner” of elections are governed by the states, and that only Congress — not the president — can make or change election laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, a federal judge in California dismissed the Justice Department’s lawsuit against California seeking to obtain its full voter roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The taking of democracy does not occur in one fell swoop; it is chipped away piece-by-piece until there is nothing left,” wrote Judge David O. Carter, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton. “The erosion of privacy and rolling back of voting rights is a decision for open and public debate within the legislative branch, not the executive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election officials also say that any national voter roll within the Justice Department would probably be rife with errors because each state’s voter file is updated every day, changing as voters move away or die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If any state were to provide a voter list, and the list against which the federal government or anyone else is checking it is out of date, you’re going to have a lot of falsely identified ineligible voters,” Mr. Simon said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26dc-trump-new-gpqc/26dc-trump-new-gpqc-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with broad outcry over the killing of a protester on Saturday in Minneapolis, the White House on Monday tried to distance President Trump from the response of his most senior officials, who had immediately characterized the man fatally shot by federal agents as a “domestic terrorist” who was “brandishing” a gun, before video evidence undercut their charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, notably did not defend the rhetoric of White House officials, including Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff, and Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, who were the most vocal in spreading false accusations against the victim, Alex Pretti. Mr. Pretti was shot roughly 10 times by immigration agents after he was apparently filming them with his camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was licensed to carry a gun in Minnesota, but video from several angles shows he never pulled one, and his hands were visible as he was shot in the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White House officials clearly understood that the killing, the second of an American citizen protesting the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minneapolis, posed one of the gravest political threats to Mr. Trump since his inauguration just a little over a year ago. Yet they seemed frozen in place, unwilling to walk back the statements by Mr. Miller and Ms. Noem, which were widely repeated throughout the administration, while sending Ms. Leavitt out to insist that “we will let the facts lead and we will let the facts play out in this investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They provided no evidence to back up the statements by the two officials, who have become the face of Mr. Trump’s efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. And while Ms. Leavitt would not contradict the two officials, she insisted to reporters that “nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America’s streets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also declined to defend the attacks on Mr. Pretti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This has obviously been a very fluid and fast-moving situation throughout the weekend,” Ms. Leavitt said. “As for President Trump, whom I speak for, he has said that he wants to let the investigation continue and let the facts lead in this case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two days, the White House has struggled to contain the fallout from the killing. Democrats have been withering in their criticism of the administration’s actions, and Republicans have begun joining calls for a fair investigation into the killing. Even the National Rifle Association, long an ally of Republican administrations, has defended Mr. Pretti, who had a concealed-carry permit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bipartisan pushback on Capitol Hill now risks another government shutdown as lawmakers threaten to withhold funding for ICE after the killing of Mr. Pretti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Mr. Trump dispatched his border chief, Tom Homan, to oversee the immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis and backed off his attacks on Minnesota’s governor after a phone call with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Homan takes over that job, it was not clear what would become of Gregory Bovino, the official in charge of Mr. Trump’s Border Patrol operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Leavitt did not directly answer a question about whether Mr. Bovino would remain in Minneapolis after Mr. Homan’s arrival. She called Mr. Bovino “a great professional” who “is going to very much continue to lead Customs and Border Patrol throughout and across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his latest pivot, Mr. Trump moved from castigating Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota as a cause of the violence in Minneapolis and declared that, in a call, they “seemed to be on a similar wavelength.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump said on social media that Mr. Walz was “happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota.” Mr. Trump announced earlier in the day that Mr. Homan would be his personal representative overseeing ICE operations in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a sharp contrast from his weekend pronunciations, in which the president blamed Mr. Walz and other Minnesota Democrats for Mr. Pretti’s death. Those remarks echoed his comments after the fatal shooting by federal agents of a Minneapolis woman, Renee Good, this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he hailed operations in Washington and other cities as a “tremendous success,” Mr. Trump said crime in Minnesota was “way down.” He added, “Both Governor Walz and I want to make it better!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Mr. Walz’s office described the call as “productive” and said the two men had discussed broader issues that have been at the center of the state’s complaints about the crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the governor’s office, Mr. Walz told Mr. Trump that impartial investigations into the two killings were needed, and he called for a reduction in the number of federal agents in Minnesota. Mr. Trump agreed to ensure a fair investigation and to look into reducing the number of agents, the governor’s office said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even as Mr. Trump tried to mend fences with Mr. Walz, Ms. Leavitt continued the administration’s previous strategy of arguing that the governor and Democrats in Minnesota bore the blame for the chaos. “This tragedy occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota for weeks,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration’s reaction to the killing of Mr. Pretti was similar to its initial approach the killing of Ms. Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, administration officials rushed to attack the victims and defend the ICE agents before an investigation had taken place. After video emerged raising serious questions about the cause for both killings, White House officials changed their tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Mr. Trump said the killing of Ms. Good was a “tragedy” about which he “felt terribly,” adding that the immigration agents he had deployed were sometimes “going to make a mistake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in tone was stark for the president, who said he had been told that Ms. Good’s father was a strong Trump supporter. No longer did the administration suggest she was a domestic terrorist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know, when the woman was shot, I felt terribly about it,” he said. “And I understand both sides of it.” He called the shooting “a horrible thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hours after Mr. Pretti’s killing, Mr. Trump referred to him as a “gunman” in a social media post. But after video emerged showing that Mr. Pretti carried a cellphone, and that agents took his legally carried gun from him before shooting him, the White House had a different message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody here at the White House, including the president of the United States, wants to see Americans hurt or killed and losing their lives in American streets,” Ms. Leavitt said on Monday. “And we mourn for the parents.”&lt;/p&gt;

Funding Suggests He Now Regrets It</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/democrats-ice-funding-vote-dhs.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26minneapolis-ice-democrats-Suozzi-cjpf/26minneapolis-ice-democrats-Suozzi-cjpf-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Tom Suozzi of New York, one of seven Democrats who broke from their party last week to provide the votes to pass a bill to fund the Homeland Security Department, told his constituents on Monday that he had “failed” in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an email sent by his re-election campaign, Mr. Suozzi, who represents a politically competitive district on Long Island, suggested that he was hearing outrage from his community about the vote and had come to regret it. He said that he fell short by not taking into account the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I failed to view the D.H.S. funding vote as a referendum on the illegal and immoral conduct of ICE in Minneapolis,” Mr. Suozzi wrote. “I hear the anger from many of my constituents, and I take responsibility for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Suozzi’s statement came two days after a federal agent shot and killed Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, an intensive care nurse, in Minneapolis. It was the second fatal shooting of a United States citizen there this month, after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent killed Renee Good, 37.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Ms. Good’s death, many Democrats in Congress refused to advance legislation that provided funding for ICE, saying no money should go to the agency without imposing severe restrictions on its tactics. But Mr. Suozzi and six other Democrats crossed party lines to pass it, in a 220 to 207 vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their backing was vital because given Republicans’ tiny margin of control, they would otherwise have lacked the votes to approve the funding bill. And while a solid contingent of Senate Democrats had been expected to follow suit and allow the measure to clear Congress this week as part of a larger spending package, they reversed course after Mr. Pretti’s shooting and are now vowing not to do so, even if it means shutting down the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Mr. Suozzi went the furthest to distance himself from his vote, other Democrats who voted for the spending bill tried to downplay funding ICE and focus attention elsewhere. In a video on social media, Representative Vicente Gonzalez of Texas said that he voted for the spending bill “not to fund ICE,” but to secure funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Coast Guard and other agencies covered by the measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we hold ICE and every other federal agency accountable, let’s do it thoughtfully, smartly,” Mr. Gonzalez said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Laura Gillen of New York, who also represents a swing district on Long Island, did not address her vote on Sunday but called for the impeachment of Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, joining dozens of Democrats who have demanded her removal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a statement on Monday, Ms. Gillen, one of the most politically vulnerable House Democrats, said that her vote on the spending bill was necessary to “fund essential disaster-relief and local and national security efforts,” and argued that the bill imposed “important guardrails for ICE, including body cameras and increased de-escalation training.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington on Sunday called the shooting “un-American” and called on Ms. Noem to step down, but she did not mention her backing for funding the department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other Democrats who joined Republicans to pass the spending bill were Representatives Henry Cuellar of Texas, Jared Golden of Maine and Don Davis of North Carolina, whose offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

Began Examining Ilhan Omar’s Finances</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/ilhan-omar-investigation-finances.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26dc-omar-photo-ctpq/26dc-omar-photo-ctpq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened an investigation into Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, in 2024 to scrutinize her finances, campaign spending and interactions with a foreign citizen, according to people with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiry, initiated by the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington and the department’s public integrity unit in June of that year, appears to have stalled for lack of evidence, according to one of the people who requested anonymity to discuss internal department matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation was thrust into the public spotlight on Monday, when President Trump blindsided department officials by posting about it on Truth Social, singling out Ms. Omar. It was part of a rambling statement announcing a shake-up of the team overseeing immigration raids in Ms. Omar’s Minneapolis district that misspelled her name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The DOJ and Congress are looking at ‘Congresswoman’ Illhan Omar, who left Somalia with NOTHING, and is now reportedly worth more than 44 Million Dollars,” he wrote. “Time will tell all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how Mr. Trump arrived at the $44 million figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Omar, a Somali-born refugee who emigrated to the United States when she was 12, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sorry, Trump, your support is collapsing and you’re panicking,” she wrote on social media on Monday. “Right on cue, you’re deflecting from your failures with lies and conspiracy theories about me. Years of ‘investigations’ have found nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicly announcing criminal investigations against political opponents has been a feature of the Trump’s administration’s approach to federal law enforcement. It violates the Justice Department’s standards of practice and can jeopardize future prosecutions by giving defense lawyers an opening to claim that investigations and prosecutions are malicious and unjustified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugly personal attacks against Ms. Omar have been a staple of Mr. Trump’s speeches since her election to Congress in 2018, when she and Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, made history as the first two Muslim women elected to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Omar’s sharp criticism of Israel, her repetition of antisemitic tropes and her comparison of U.S. actions to those of Hamas have elicited bipartisan criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But few people have demonized her more than Mr. Trump, who has veered into racist and xenophobic vitriol, in the view of Ms. Omar and other critics of the president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 2020 election, Mr. Trump would often goad his supporters to chant “send her back” to Somalia. Ms. Omar, who has not bristled from fighting back against the president, appears to still be a fixation of his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump recently called her “garbage” at a cabinet meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, House Republicans have threatened to open their own investigation into Ms. Omar, an apparent effort to tie her to the Minnesota fraud scandal that has revealed evidence that some members of the Somali community set up companies that billed state agencies for social services that were never provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative James R. Comer of Kentucky, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has vowed to subpoena Ms. Omar’s husband. His venture capital firm made millions over the past few years, according to Ms. Omar’s financial disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No evidence has yet been produced showing that Ms. Omar was connected to the fraud scheme. A spokeswoman for Ms. Omar said her office had received no official inquiries from the Oversight Committee or the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Comer is still seeking to raise ethical questions about how Ms. Omar’s husband has been able to accumulate his wealth and he has promised an update on a potential investigation soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Omar has been under intense pressure since her community became a main target of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think we’re in for a lot of pain as Americans during this presidency,” she said in an interview with The New York Times in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a desire to purify the country from any brown and Black people,” Ms. Omar said. “A lot of their policies and rhetoric seems to be rooted in white supremacy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26DC-ASSESS-top-pljf/26DC-ASSESS-top-pljf-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after federal agents carrying out President Trump’s immigration crackdown shot an unarmed woman in her car and handcuffed a preschooler this month, a solid bloc of Democrats in the Senate had appeared ready to swallow their outrage and vote to fund the Homeland Security Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But following the shocking fatal shooting in Minneapolis over the weekend, Democrats have pivoted sharply, and are confident they are now on solid political ground as they draw a hard line against approving any money for the agency that has executed chaotic and violent operations across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the imminent prospect of a second crippling government shutdown in less than three months and the potential for a backlash, Democrats say they believe they have public opinion on their side as many Americans have recoiled from videos of the shooting of Alex Pretti and the earlier death of Renee Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are insisting that Republicans abandon efforts this week to include a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security in a package of measures needed to keep federal agencies funded past Friday, at least until new controls on its agents are put in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have little choice. Their political base has made it clear it would revolt if Democrats went ahead and passed the funding in the wake of the fatal shootings by government agents. Democrats do not want to risk such blowback from their strongest supporters as the midterms loom and the party sees a strong chance for gains in both the House and Senate. And they see the shootings as an abomination that demands a strong response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my 15 years in the United States Senate, I have never seen our caucus more unified or fired up with outrage and energy to stop these absolutely abhorrent, brutal tactics that exemplify a police state, not the greatest democracy in the world,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Just days ago, Senate Democrats were clearing the way for the final spending bills of the fiscal year to be approved, a rare achievement in recent years. They lacked the appetite for another shutdown, particularly after they came out of last year’s believing they had put Republicans on defense over health care policy. It looked like the spending fights were about to be wrapped up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the shooting death of Mr. Pretti after he was apparently disarmed has upended the Capitol as Democrats dig in and urge Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican and majority leader, to break off the homeland security money from five other spending measures so most of the government could be funded past the Jan. 30 deadline despite the outcry over the shootings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and minority leader, said in a statement on Monday. “If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Democrats who broke with their party last fall to bring the last shutdown to an end have said that they would oppose the homeland security spending legislation without significant changes. They have made their position known to Republicans who might have seen them as a potential path around Mr. Schumer. Republicans would need at least seven Democrats to join them in advancing the bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reform is urgently needed at the Department of Homeland Security, and their dishonest response to the death of a U.S. citizen only underscores that,” Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, one of the Democrats who brokered the deal to end last fall’s shutdown, said Monday. “I will vote against D.H.S.’s funding until additional reforms are in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Republicans insist they will push ahead with all six bills as a package, putting themselves on a collision course with Democrats and raising the risk that much of the government will shut down after midnight Friday. Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who leads the Appropriations Committee, on Monday urged lawmakers to avoid that outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope we can come together in a constructive way to get this done and to ensure that we do not lurch into a dangerous and detrimental government shutdown,” she said during a brief Senate session Monday, even as she acknowledged that Mr. Pretti’s “tragic death” had increased scrutiny on the homeland security bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though some Republicans have expressed serious reservations about the events in Minneapolis, they will be reluctant to give in to Democratic demands since it could be interpreted as an admission that the Trump administration has acted improperly. The majority also never wants to be dictated to by the minority, whatever the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Democrats have hardened their position, Senate Republicans have suggested a deal could be struck between the White House and Democrats, but Democratic officials said on Monday that no progress toward such an agreement had been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Senate conservatives have made it clear they do not want Mr. Thune to grant any concessions to Democrats and that Republicans should be ready to make sure the blame for a shutdown falls on Democrats if they hold out against a package of spending bills they were about to approve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll oppose any effort to defund DHS,” Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, wrote on X. “Every Republican should.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are incentives for Republicans to reach some accommodation with Democrats in addition to sparing the government another prolonged disruption. Fears are mounting within the party that the immigration crackdown in Minnesota and elsewhere is backfiring with voters, potentially neutralizing what Republicans see as one of their strongest political issues. Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate also have invested significant time and effort in writing the spending bills that contain their priorities, and they don’t want to see them die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But working out any solution before Friday absent some significant retreat by either party will prove difficult. Even if there were an agreement, the House is out for the week and would need to approve any revisions in the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats are still determining their precise demands for new restrictions on immigration agents. But possibilities they are discussing include requirements around judicial arrest warrants, elimination of quotas for arrests, visible identification on agents, an end to indiscriminate sweeps and a clear course of action to hold officers legally accountable for wrongdoing. Mr. Schumer described the framework to his colleagues on a Sunday conference call as “restrict, reform and restrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The showdown carries significant political risks for Democrats. They are threatening to again shut down a wide swath of the government and potentially disrupt services such as airport security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency as the nation deals with winter storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2018, Democrats forced the government to shut down as they tried to win legal protections for hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children. But they backed down just three days in when they determined that they lacked popular support for the tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though immigration policy is part of this dispute, Democrats see it as a dramatically different situation in which the public is squarely behind them. They say they are willing to take the heat to win new limits on the federal agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have no choice,” Mr. Blumenthal said, “given the strength of our determination to impose some restraints and reforms on an out-of-control agency.”&lt;/p&gt;

In the moments leading up to the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, federal agents had acted in ways that raised serious questions among policing experts.

Protesters in Minneapolis gather near where Alex Pretti was killed. It is rare for state and local police to try to investigate federal law enforcement officials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26dc-dhs-investigate-photo-cgwh/26dc-dhs-investigate-photo-cgwh-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration appeared to acknowledge on Monday that its investigation into the killing of a Veterans Affairs nurse, Alex Pretti, by federal agents this weekend was limited to a “use of force” review meant to establish whether government employees had violated training standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a move, disclosed in court filings, would represent a much narrower inquiry focused on tactics and conduct than one that would examine whether federal agents should face criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the administration’s efforts to block a judge from ordering it to preserve evidence, Mark Zito, who leads the Homeland Security Investigations office in St. Paul, Minnesota, provided the court with a sworn statement that noted that his agency, which belongs to the Department of Homeland Security, is investigating the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“H.S.I. is the lead investigatory entity reviewing the use-of-force encounter at issue in this case,” Mr. Zito’s declaration said. “H.S.I. agents tasked with this investigation are required to preserve all evidence collected, including physical evidence collected by other federal agencies, which are then properly transferred to the custody of H.S.I.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minnesota state officials have sought a court order to preserve evidence for their own investigation of the killing of Mr. Pretti, who was repeatedly shot by Border Patrol agents on Saturday. The Trump administration is fighting such an order, claiming that it is already preserving the relevant evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical terms in Mr. Zito’s statement are “use of force” and “reviewing.” Among federal law enforcement agencies, a use of force review is focused on whether law enforcement personnel followed agency rules and regulations and where and when to use force, and how much force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is distinct from a criminal investigation. F.B.I. agents could, for example, investigate to determine if Mr. Pretti’s civil rights were violated by federal agents acting under color of law, a crime that carries the possibility of a death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F.B.I. could also investigate whether Mr. Pretti assaulted or impeded a federal law enforcement officer, although there is limited practical use to such an investigation, given that Mr. Pretti is dead and cannot be charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no indication yet that the F.B.I. is doing either. Whatever the Trump administration investigates, their determinations may not be the last word, since there is no statute of limitations on murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An F.B.I. spokesman declined to comment. A D.H.S. spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court filings suggest that, so far, the F.B.I.’s involvement is limited to assisting the Department of Homeland Security in its use-of-force review. F.B.I. agents arrived quickly on the scene of Mr. Pretti’s killing and secured his weapon and his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F.B.I. has since turned over Mr. Pretti’s phone to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but not his gun, according to Mr. Zito’s sworn statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The F.B.I. has not altered or destroyed the collected evidence,” an unidentified F.B.I. agent declared in a sworn statement to the court. It also added that the evidence is secure in the F.B.I.’s Minneapolis office and that no one there “has conducted any analysis, examinations, or interpretations of the collected evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement does not say whether other F.B.I. personnel, such as forensic experts at their lab in Quantico, Virginia, have examined any evidence, or a digital copy of Mr. Pretti’s phone data. “The F.B.I. will continue to preserve the collected evidence in accordance with the F.B.I.’s policies and procedures for evidence retention,” it noted. “In no event will any collected evidence be destroyed before resolution of this investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, some of the Border Patrol agents at the scene of the killing were wearing body cameras, and that footage has been retained, according to court filings. Many Border Patrol agents do not wear body cameras, so it is unclear how much footage there may be, or how much can be gleaned from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/newsletter-1-gjqf/newsletter-1-gjqf-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young asylum-seeking family, terrified to go outside or even to look out of the window. Parents of elementary schoolers, struggling to explain to their children why their Latino classmates were staying home. Another fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the painful and extraordinary scenes my colleagues in Minneapolis are documenting during the federal immigration crackdown there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fast-moving, fluid and unpredictable situation, as the sudden move to reassign Greg Bovino shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But increasingly, one thing seems clear: The country is now paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderate Democratic lawmakers have called for Kristi Noem, who leads the Department of Homeland Security, to step aside or to be impeached. At least some Republicans have broken with the Trump administration in expressing grave concerns or, in some cases, urging a full independent investigation into the fatal shooting on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, who rarely weigh in on the day-to-day moves of the Trump administration, cast the moment as an inflection point for the country, with core American values and freedoms under real threat. And over a weekend when many Americans were snowed in, plenty of people around the country who don’t usually post about politics took to social media to talk about Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sense of all of this, I turned to my colleague Charles Homans, who just wrote a deeply reported piece capturing how the Trump administration’s immigration operations are stoking fear and chaos across Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s well worth reading in full. In the meantime, here’s our conversation, edited and condensed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie Glueck: In your story, you mentioned that many of the people pushing back aren’t what we might usually think of as activists. Who are they, and how would you describe them politically?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Homans: I was struck by what a broad cross-section of Minneapolis liberals and progressives I saw participating in one way or another in the resistance to the federal deployment. The Twin Cities are overwhelmingly Democratic and have a real culture of political engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But participation is not the same as activism. Most of these people were not in the streets in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd, for instance, and a lot of them were very ambivalent about the aftermath of his killing in the city. What you are seeing now is a much broader kind of engagement, where even people who are not attending protests or following federal immigration agents with their phones are doing little things through their schools and churches, or with local businesses, to stand in the way of the federal operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KG: You also wrote about the parents — particularly those with kids attending schools with larger Latino populations, it sounded like — whose “latent politics had been supercharged by a very parental mix of fear and fury.” What does that look like in practice? Is this a newly engaged political demographic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CH: In Minneapolis, I think these are people who were pretty politically engaged to begin with. One big question I have, which is a good subject for further reporting, is whether this is the same farther out into the exurbs, where you start getting into constituencies who are more politically mixed and maybe less political in general, but confronting similar circumstances. The raids have happened there, too. They’ve just been less well-documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KG: Watching from New York, at least, the events in Minneapolis seem to have broken through with parts of the public in a way I’m not sure I’ve seen in the second Trump administration. Is that your sense, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CH: It does feel that way. You always want to be careful about over-interpreting these moments in the moment itself. But even before the first fatal shooting by a federal agent in Minneapolis this month, polls had shown approval of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s tactics really tanking, especially among independents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans have contradictory and ambivalent views about immigration, and what should be done to control it. The administration’s tactics and messaging have forced voters to think harder about that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly the biggest factor here is the video that Minnesotans have been gathering. There’s the footage of the shootings themselves, and the administration’s false or misleading accounts of what happened — which have been easy to see through even for people who are not especially engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KG: How does this moment in Minneapolis compare with the protests there after the murder of George Floyd?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CH: I asked a lot of people in Minneapolis about that, and the consensus, which I think is true, was that they are extremely different. The George Floyd protests, riots and ensuing debate about defunding or reorganizing the Minneapolis Police Department produced a deep division within the Twin Cities’ Democratic majority that was never really healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But pretty much none of these people disagree about the federal deployment. And amid all of the fury and alarm of the present moment, there is a very palpable sense of relief among a lot of these people that they are on common ground, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KG: You mentioned the Defund the Police movement, something Democratic leaders came to see as a huge political liability nationally. Is there any concern among Democrats you talked to that scenes of unrest, or pushes to abolish ICE, could backfire for them politically?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CH: Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, has clearly been trying to keep the Minneapolis Police Department out of the mix as much as possible. And for now, the balance of violence in the footage coming out of the city lies clearly on the side of the federal agents, who have shot and killed two people in the midst of what has been extremely angry but overwhelmingly nonviolent resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does seem that so far, this has kept a lot of the ghosts of 2020 at bay. What is clear on the street in Minneapolis is that this is really a tightrope walk, and I think it is much more so since the second fatal shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KG: Anything I didn’t ask you about on the political front that you think is important for people to understand about Minneapolis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CH: I wrote about this in another piece this month, but I do think that Minnesota’s particular political history, of which the state’s liberals are very proud, is very relevant to how Minneapolitans see what they are doing now, and the stakes of what they are doing. They see themselves as fighting for a civic ideal that is directly under attack by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A curious demand stuck out in Attorney General Pam Bondi’s letter to Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota over the weekend laying out what must happen to restore “law and order” to the state: Hand over your voter rolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague Nick Corasaniti, who covers voting rights and elections, explains why the Trump administration is seeking voters’ private data from states across the country, and the concerns surrounding the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the percentage of American voters who believe a middle-class lifestyle is out of reach for most people, a New York Times/Siena poll found. It reflects the nation’s pessimistic mood as another midterm election year kicks off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QUOTE OF THE DAy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s Oscar Hagelsieb, a retired immigration officer and special agent. He voted three times for President Trump but is now feeling anger and despair about the administration’s deployment of his former agency: “It’s completely unfair to the agents who have been put in this position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONE LAST THING&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For newly elected mayors, major weather events can pose tough tests of leadership. So far, my colleagues Sally Goldenberg and Dana Rubinstein write, Mayor Zohran Mamdani of New York City has seemed to clear early hurdles with his handling of the snowstorm this weekend. But Gov. Kathy Hochul — his political pal, at least for now — had some feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thanks for helping out our neighbors,” she wrote on social media in response to a video Mamdani shared that showed him trying to help a car stuck in the snow. “But put on a hat!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Homans and Taylor Robinson contributed reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/dc-airspace-promo-hbwv/dc-airspace-promo-hbwv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year after two seemingly routine flights above Washington, D.C., ended in a deadly midair collision, some efforts to make the airspace significantly safer have faltered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration, which controls the airspace, has asked airlines to modify their schedules to reduce the number of flights per hour at Ronald Reagan National Airport until the facility can handle a more normal tempo. The agency has also closed the air route that an Army helicopter was traversing when it collided with a passenger jet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But control tower staffing is not much higher than it was at the time of the crash, according to F.A.A. figures. And morale within the tower remains low, according to two people who have spent time there recently, raising concerns about readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other steps that crash victims’ families had hoped would help protect fliers in the Washington skies seem to be languishing amid congressional inaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An air safety bill that recently passed the Senate faces opposition in the House, threatening its viability. And despite years of concerns by the F.A.A. and some lawmakers about congestion in the airspace around National Airport, there has been no meaningful discussion of permanently removing flight routes in and out of the airport to reduce the load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collision occurred Jan. 29, 2025, when an Army Black Hawk flew into American Airlines Flight 5342, which was on its way to land at National Airport from Wichita, Kan. Everyone aboard both aircraft died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, the U.S. government admitted liability for the collision. As part of a civil suit brought by the family of one of the victims, the Justice Department said that the Army pilots flying a Black Hawk helicopter that night failed to maintain separation from the jet. Officials also acknowledged that the controller did not provide proper instructions, but denied that the lapse was the cause of the crash for the purpose of monetary damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An F.A.A. spokeswoman, Hannah Walden, said that the agency has taken steps to increase safety since the tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Sean Duffy was confirmed as transportation secretary, “he and the F.A.A. have taken decisive steps to correct past failures, strengthen accountability, and modernize” the national airspace, Ms. Walden said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are acting proactively to mitigate risks,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety Board, the independent government agency that has been investigating the crash, will share its findings on the cause of the collision and the circumstances around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The N.T.S.B. will also share recommendations for ways to improve safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safety board fast-tracked its report to help bring closure to a frightening and impactful aviation crash, the nation’s deadliest in 24 years. The Army said it will work with the board to support “lasting improvements” in aviation safety, and the F.A.A. said it will “diligently consider” the board’s additional advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to some who lost loved ones in the crash, the fixes that have been made since last January have been too gradual, and too reactive, to be satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Lane, a Barrington, R.I., man who lost his wife, Christine, and 16-year-old son, Spencer, in the plane crash, said in an interview that, in his view, the F.A.A. has not been proactive about its own role as a safety agent. It instead looks to Congress for direction, he said, when crises happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m kind of willing to forgive for things that happened before Jan. 29, 2025,” he said. “But I think the way that people react after that means a lot to me. And I’ve really gotten the sense that they have made no effort to learn from this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Airport tower had been a troubled workplace before the crash, struggling with chronic understaffing and safety lapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, conditions have improved at the tower, said two people who have spent time there recently who were not authorized to speak publicly, but morale has still not bounced back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Walden said the F.A.A. conducts “regular wellness checks” at the facility to talk to the team there and listen to “any concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the tower employs 22 of the 30 controllers it is approved for, according to the F.A.A., an improvement over the 19 controllers it had at the time of the collision, but not by much. The F.A.A. noted that controllers there are currently working with eight trainees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before staffing got to its current levels, there was a wave of departures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some controllers who were working on Jan. 29 went on leave immediately, people who were familiar with the matter told The New York Times at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times would like to hear about your experience as a federal worker under the second Trump administration. We may reach out about your submission, but we will not publish any part of your response without contacting you first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, including senior managers, were relocated to different facilities in the aftermath of the crash, N.T.S.B. hearings revealed. The senior-most position in the tower, air traffic manager, has been occupied by three people within the past year. Still other management positions have gone unfilled, at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Jarvis, an F.A.A. contractor who worked in the tower for years until his retirement in October, said he was bothered by the fact that certain management jobs had remained vacant in recent years and that others were occupied by people who had no knowledge of Washington’s skies, a sign that the agency has not always prioritized the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The F.A.A. and the public consider D.C.A. a gem,” said Mr. Jarvis, using a shorthand for the D.C. airport. “We have not treated it like a gem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, some controllers struggled psychologically in the aftermath of the crash, according to N.T.S.B. officials and others who spent time in the tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the weeks and months after Jan. 29, N.T.S.B. investigators who were interviewing controllers sometimes found them highly distressed, said Jennifer Homendy, the N.T.S.B. chair. Some cried during conversations. One was spotted sleeping at their workstation, she said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two months after the crash, two investigators who had gone to the tower to conduct additional interviews were made aware of an altercation that had just occurred: one controller had punched another controller after a verbal argument that had grown heated, Ms. Homendy said. The aggressor was arrested by airport police, according to a Virginia court summons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that point, “our air traffic control team was really concerned about the well-being of the controllers in the tower,” Ms. Homendy said. She called the acting administrator at the F.A.A. as well as the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and contacts on Capitol Hill to ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F.A.A. declined to comment on the altercation or the call from Ms. Homendy. The agency noted that it has brought in four controllers from other sites to augment staffing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reagan National Airport has in some ways been a victim of its own popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades ago, it was established as the short-haul complement to the nearby Dulles International Airport, whose sprawling footprint and longer runways could more easily accommodate longer-haul flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But National Airport’s convenient location made it irresistible to many Washingtonians, including elected officials, who travel in and out often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, a series of congressional waivers have allowed airlines to add new and longer routes to the airport’s roster, adding to controller workload and to airspace congestion. In 2024, five new round-trip routes were added despite F.A.A. concerns about the strains those flights could add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last January’s midair collision came on the heels of a banner year for travel. National Airport set a record for the number of commercial passengers handled. The tower’s controllers had also been busy handling frequent military, medical evacuation and local law enforcement helicopters that passed through, often on very short notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the crash, the F.A.A. initially reduced the number of hourly flights into National Airport from 36 to 26, but the number is now back up to 30. It also reduced helicopter traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figures kept by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which operates National Airport and Dulles, show that between January and October of 2024, 21.9 million passengers traveled through National Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the same period in 2025, the figure was 20.9 million, a 4.6 percent drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, family members of the crash victims say they know of no significant efforts on Capitol Hill to permanently reduce flights, even though many believe that airport congestion remains a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some lawmakers agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I remain extremely concerned by the amount of air traffic in and out of D.C.A.,” said Senator Tim Kaine, the Virginia Democrat, in an emailed statement. “This is some of the most complex and crowded airspace in the country, and every additional flight that is crammed into it stretches an already overburdened runway and air traffic control work force.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kaine said he wants to work on removing routes from National Airport as soon as the N.T.S.B. and Army release their investigative findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some victims’ families and N.T.S.B. officials say one of the most frustrating policy debates since the crash has been the back-and-forth over a cockpit system that allows aircraft to broadcast their locations and whether those should be mandatory to be used on military training flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That broadcasting system, which is a fixture on all commercial planes and the majority of military helicopters, provides real-time information to other pilots and controllers on an aircraft’s location in the skies, allowing others to track and avoid hitting it. But the Army, citing the need for confidentiality in case it is flying to secure locations, has long had a waiver on the system’s use, including for training flights, the type of flight that was occurring on Jan. 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the crash, the F.A.A. ruled that the Army must use the system, even for training flights. But the mandate was unwound late last year in the annual defense spending bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate last month passed an aviation safety bill that would revert to requiring the broadcasting system be turned on, along with a passel of other new aviation-safety measures that would secure skies in Washington and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Representative Sam Graves, the Missouri Republican who leads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has called the bill “emotional” and has said he won’t support it as written, effectively relegating it to a back burner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, he said in a statement to The Times that he was waiting to see the N.T.S.B. findings before “considering the best way forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.T.S.B. officials and relatives of people who died in the collision have bemoaned the setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a text to The Times, Sheri Lilley, the stepmother of Sam Lilley, the first officer of the American Airlines flight, noted that the N.T.S.B. began recommending the broadcast system be activated 17 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If those recommendations had been heeded at that time, this tragedy would not have happened,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

Rolls Out Agency Overhaul for Improving Air Safety</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/faa-overhaul-safety-modernization.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26dc-faa-cjtp/26dc-faa-cjtp-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration is overhauling its internal structure to modernize and increase safety, its leaders announced on Monday, in a shake-up intended to make the agency more responsive at a time of heightened focus on improving the security of air travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F.A.A.’s new organizational chart will concentrate safety oversight functions in a new, single office instead of leaving them spread among several divisions. The agency will also open an airspace modernization office to support its efforts toward a new air traffic control system, and create a division focused solely on drones, air taxis and other advanced aircraft. The new structure also consolidates many of the agency’s administrative functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, in a single office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and the F.A.A. administrator, Bryan Bedford, announced the new structure on Monday, just ahead of the first anniversary of a midair collision outside Ronald Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people and prompted a public outcry for improved aviation safety. Many of the changes were mandated by Congress in 2024, as part of a bill authorizing the F.A.A.’s activities for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With these critical organizational changes, the F.A.A. can streamline the bureaucracy, encourage innovation and deliver a new air traffic control system,” Mr. Duffy said in a statement, adding that safety would be enhanced along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new plan also calls for some F.A.A. offices, including the new one responsible for drones and other advanced aviation technologies, answering to the agency’s deputy administrator, Chris Rocheleau, instead of directly to Mr. Bedford. Mr. Duffy’s and Mr. Bedford’s announcement said that no layoffs were expected as part of the restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26minneapolis-ice-Reversal-ftcw/26minneapolis-ice-Reversal-ftcw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Randy Fine, a hard-right Republican from Florida, has regularly warned about the perils of federal government overreach during his decade-long career in government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a state legislator, he described federal Covid-19 vaccination mandates as “tyrannical.” As a member of Congress, he supported the elimination of the Department of Education, stating, “Federal bureaucrats shouldn’t dictate how our kids are taught.” In a 2022 social media post, Mr. Fine, memorably and menacingly, addressed President Joseph R. Biden Jr. over gun control, telling him, “try to take our guns and you’ll learn why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this weekend, Mr. Fine took to X.com to voice his approval that federal immigration officers in Minneapolis had killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse whose filming of immigration officers on Saturday morning turned into a confrontation. The officers shot Mr. Pretti at least 10 times after one of them had removed a holstered gun that he was legally authorized to carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An armed seditionist attacked federal law enforcement today as they were rounding up foreign invaders in Minneapolis,” Mr. Fine wrote on Saturday, without evidence that Mr. Pretti had been there to attack anyone. “The insurrectionist was put down. Well done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American conservatives have a long history of supporting gun rights and states’ rights, as well as calling for firm restraint on the federal government. And they have criticized the excessive use of federal power in a number of bloody confrontations with recalcitrant citizens, including a white separatist family in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992, and the Branch Davidians cult the following year in Waco, Texas, both by agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the case of the Minneapolis deployment, the Trump administration and some allies like Mr. Fine have taken positions that seem to contradict some of the bedrock principles of conservatism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deployment, called Operation Metro Surge, would seem like the definition of big-government action. Gov. Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey, both Democrats, vehemently oppose federal intervention, as do many residents of largely liberal Minneapolis. Agents, wearing masks to hide their identities, have forced their way into homes without warrants. They have detained citizens and legal immigrants. And then, there are the killings of Mr. Pretti and Renee Good, the mother of three shot on Jan. 7 while driving her S.U.V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, many Republicans see Mr. Trump’s effort as a fundamentally conservative strategy — an effort to to rid the United States of all illegal immigrants, which they say upholds the rule of law and maintains national sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incongruity has set off a roiling series of debates about the very nature of conservatism, often within the sphere of conservatism itself, even as Mr. Trump softened his position on Monday and said that he was sending Tom Homan, his border czar, to Minneapolis and that Mr. Homan would work more closely with local officials. Mayor Frey said in a statement late Monday that some federal agents would leave the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a phone interview on Monday, Representative Fine argued that there was no disconnect between his support for Operation Metro Surge and his broader belief that the federal government should be reined in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not at all,” he said. “The most fundamental responsibility of the federal government is to secure the border and to protect Americans. ICE is rounding up foreign invaders who have been instructed to leave the country and have refused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other Republicans are voicing concerns. Former Vice President Mike Pence wrote on social media on Monday that the images of the shooting of Mr. Pretti were “deeply troubling,” adding that “a full and transparent investigation of this officer involved shooting must take place immediately.” Senators Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Jerry Moran, of Kansas, also called for an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our Constitution provides citizens protection from the government,” Mr. Moran wrote. “We have a right to free speech, to peaceably assemble and to bear arms. We also expect government to protect us from lawless behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview this week, Erick Erickson, the conservative pundit and radio host from Georgia, said he supports the administration’s mass deportation goals. But he said he was “uncomfortable” with the recently disclosed guidance drafted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials stating that deportation officers are allowed to enter homes to arrest people without judicial warrants. And he described Mr. Trump’s recent threat to invoke the Insurrection Act and send troops to Minnesota as “overkill” and “too provocative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Erickson said that the current disagreements over the Minnesota surge are part of a broader debate about shifting definitions of conservatism in the Trump era, as the president has embraced once-taboo ideas like the imposition of tariffs and government investment in private companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Erickson was among a number of conservatives who took issue over the weekend with assertions by Trump officials and allies who criticized Mr. Pretti for bringing a gun to a protest. Among them was Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been to a protest,” Mr. Bessent said in an interview with ABC’s Jonathan Karl. “Guess what? I didn’t bring a gun. I brought a billboard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bessent is wrong,” Mr. Erickson wrote on X.com “I know plenty of people who participate in political events, including protests, and have their guns. It is their right. While we can say the man should not have gotten in an altercation with agents, merely exercising his 2A right with his 1A right is irrelevant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Stitt, the Republican governor of Oklahoma and the chair of the National Governors Association, told CNN on Sunday that while Mr. Trump’s promise to close the border was popular, the killings of Mr. Pretti and Ms. Good were “causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also suggested that the federal response was violating the principle that the political will of states should not be overrun by an overzealous federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe in federalism and state rights,” Mr. Still said. “And nobody likes feds coming into their state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump’s threat to invoke the Insurrection Act earlier this month has also become a delicate issue among Republicans, especially those vying for their party’s nomination in the upcoming Minnesota governor’s race. Earlier this month, The Minnesota Star Tribune reported that “several” G.O.P. candidates “would not explicitly say whether they would support President Donald Trump deploying the military to Minnesota to tamp down protests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One exception was Mike Lindell, the pro-Trump conspiracy theorist, MyPillow chief executive and Minnesota native. He said he would support “whatever it takes” to stop what he considered to be unlawful protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side was Chris Madel, a Minneapolis lawyer who said he would not support invocation of the Insurrection Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Madel dropped out of the governor’s race on Monday and leveled harsh words against some fellow Republicans. “I cannot support the national Republicans stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most pointed criticism of the surge has, perhaps unsurprisingly, come from libertarians, many of whom have repeatedly chafed at Trump policies not deemed sufficiently in line with their small-government ethos. Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, the libertarian think tank, has noted that protesters in Minnesota have been “repeatedly attacked” while filming or nonviolently protesting the enforcement actions, “in what looks very much like a practice that is being tolerated by policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even among libertarians, there is disagreement. Angela McArdle, a former chair of the Libertarian Party, argued this weekend that the nation was in crisis mode and that now was not a time for libertarians to stick so strictly to their ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The threat of mass migration is civilizational,” Ms. McArdle wrote on X on Sunday, adding: “It sucks that ICE shoots people sometimes. If we don’t deport illegal aliens and stop Democrat fraud, we will be Canada in less than 10 years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26dc-trump-invest-lzpf/26dc-trump-invest-lzpf-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration announced on Monday that it had agreed to extend up to $277 million in direct funding and up to $1.3 billion in loans to USA Rare Earth Inc., a mining and manufacturing group, to help develop its supply chain for rare earth metals and magnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal adds to the administration’s growing portfolio of equity stakes in private companies, and it would help expand domestic production of a critical input for cars, robots, semiconductors, drones and other products. China, which dominates the production of rare earth minerals and magnets, began clamping down on its export last year, and companies have struggled to find other sources of supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commerce Department, which arranged the financing through a semiconductor investment program set up during the Biden administration, said it had signed a nonbinding letter of intent to provide the funding, subject to further due diligence and approvals. The deal will give the Commerce Department approximately 16 million shares in the company, as well as a warrant to acquire another 17.6 million shares, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce, said in a statement that the company’s project was essential to “restoring U.S. critical mineral independence.” The investment “ensures our supply chains are resilient and no longer reliant on foreign nations,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the company also announced that it had raised $1.5 billion through a consortium of private investors. For that transaction, Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall Street firm formerly headed by Mr. Lutnick, acted as the lead placement agent, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overlap between the Trump administration and Cantor Fitzgerald has recently been under scrutiny by Democratic lawmakers and others, after revelations by The New York Times that the Wall Street firm profited off several projects that Mr. Lutnick promoted in his official role as commerce secretary. Mr. Lutnick has divested from Cantor Fitzgerald, but the firm is now led by two of his sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Weisman, the co-president of Public Citizen, a government ethics watchdog group that has been critical of the Trump administration, described the ties as concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that the deal is brokered by the Wall Street firm formerly run by the Commerce Secretary — and now headed by his sons — is reason to worry that the public interest is being subordinated, yet again, to the profit seeking of Trump cronies,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commerce department official said that the CHIPS office worked directly with USA Rare Earth on the government deal, with no involvement from Cantor Fitzgerald. Cantor Fitzgerald declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has now announced deals to take equity stakes in at least 10 private companies, in an unusual strategy for a Republican administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the deals involve the metals and mining sector, which the government has been trying to build up to ensure strategic independence from China. But the administration has also taken stake, or the option to acquire it, in the chipmaker Intel, the nuclear firm Westinghouse and U.S. Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While critics say the practice risks distorting the private market, the Trump administration has argued that the deals give American taxpayers more benefits when companies succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding announced on Monday is expected to support two projects, a mine anticipated to begin commercial production in Texas in 2028, and a manufacturing project in Oklahoma. USA Rare Earths would be the only company in the United States that would mine minerals containing rare earths, extract rare earth oxides, convert them to metals and turn that into the feedstock for magnets, the Commerce Department said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal investigators are reviewing body camera footage related to the killing of Alex Pretti, the 37-year-old nurse who was fatally shot in Minneapolis on Saturday by federal agents involved in President Trump’s immigration crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is body camera footage from multiple angles, which investigators are currently reviewing,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to The New York Times on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The footage could shed new light on the killing of Mr. Pretti, who was an intensive-care nurse at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Minneapolis. Administration officials quickly branded Mr. Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” after he was killed, even as videos of the encounter contradicted their narrative and D.H.S.’s account of the events leading up to the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Mr. Pretti was killed, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office and Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension filed a lawsuit against several federal agencies and officials, including D.H.S. and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to prevent the destruction of evidence related to the killing. A federal judge in Minnesota on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order barring federal officials from destroying evidence related to the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a memo filed Monday opposing the temporary restraining order, D.H.S. and other government agencies said that “the evidence is being preserved; nothing has been destroyed or altered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence is being stored in a secure evidence room at the F.B.I.’s Minneapolis field office, according to the memo. The document also stated that “CBP has preserved all relevant body-worn camera footage from the incident and will do so for 75 years,” referring to Customs and Border Protection, which includes U.S. Border Patrol, one of the two main homeland security agencies involved in the immigration crackdown, alongside ICE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos on social media that were verified by The New York Times contradict D.H.S.’s account of Mr. Pretti’s killing. The department said the episode began after a man “approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun” and they tried to disarm him. Footage shows Mr. Pretti was holding a phone, not a gun, before agents pulled him to the ground and shot him.&lt;/p&gt;
