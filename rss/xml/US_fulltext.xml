&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27nat-census-fjcl/27nat-census-fjcl-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States population grew last year at one of the slowest rates in its history, according to new numbers released on Tuesday by the Census Bureau. The immigration numbers plunged by more than 50 percent from the previous year, under the aggressive anti-immigration policies of President Trump. And the birthrate continued its nearly two-decade long decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation’s population increased by about 1.8 million over the year, and stood at almost 342 million on July 1, the estimates say. That is a growth rate of about 0.5 percent, the lowest since 2021, when the Covid-19 pandemic caused deaths to soar and borders to close, shutting the door to international migration. That year saw the slowest growth since the nation’s founding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new census estimates measure changes in the population from June 30, 2024, to July 1, 2025, capturing the last months of the Biden administration, when it tightened border policies, and the early months of the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over that time, net immigration added almost 1.3 million people to the U.S. population. That number is considerably lower than that of 2024, when, under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., immigration reached a record high of just over 2.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Trump continues his term, immigration is expected to drop even further. If current trends continue, it will fall to about 321,000 for the year ending on June 30, according to a Census Bureau news release. That would be lower than during the pandemic year, when net international migration dropped to 376,000, one of the lowest points in modern history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The basic goal here was to stop people coming over the border illegally and being released, and to ramp up interior enforcement to actually remove people,” Simon Hankinson, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said of Mr. Trump’s immigration policy. “This is an indicator that much of the strategy is working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has pledged to bring down levels of illegal immigration through a border shutdown and mass deportations. But although net immigration has declined substantially, it has still not reached the point where more people are leaving the country than arriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the country’s attention has been focused on raids and deportations, those actions accounted for relatively little of the overall decline in net immigration of about 1.5 million. The Census Bureau does not break down what caused the drop, but a New York Times analysis found that about 230,000 people were deported from the United States over the entirety of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That suggests that deportations are not directly responsible for most of the decline in net immigration numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The border shutdown was a major part of the decline. Other factors that contributed to the drop include the increased difficulty of getting visas and foreign citizens who chose not to come to the United States, or to leave on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was expecting that the decline would be bigger than we’re seeing here,” said William Frey, chief demographer at the left-leaning Brookings Institution. “This is still over a million people coming in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though several estimates have been made of the change in the immigrant population since President Trump came into office, the estimates by the Census Bureau on Tuesday are the first gold-standard set of federal figures to be made public. They attempt to account for both legal and illegal immigration, as well as deportations and voluntary departures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government’s population numbers are a measure of a nation’s demographic health, and take account of births and deaths as well as immigration, emigration and deportation. The country needs a large enough population of young workers and taxpayers to finance care for the nation’s older residents, whose numbers are swelling as the Baby Boom generation retires. Growth that is too rapid can also present problems, taxing resources and driving up the cost of housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sharp drop in the birthrate also contributed to the slowdown in population growth. The birthrate has been falling since the Great Recession in 2008, and new births outpaced deaths by only about 518,000 in the latest period. That is higher than during the peak of the Covid pandemic, when deaths were soaring, but it is still extremely low by historical standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What has been carrying the United States through this decade has been immigration,” said Kenneth Johnson, a demographer at the University of New Hampshire. “My question is, what will happen to the population if we go to negative immigration?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted that in the decade from 2010 to 2020, immigration made up about 40 percent of the overall population growth, while births supplied about 60 percent. But since 2020, as the birthrate has declined, immigration has taken up a larger and larger share, and now accounts for around 80 percent of overall growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lowering immigration at a time when our birthrate is falling is a recipe for lower growth for our economy and weaker international competition,” said Julia Gelatt, an associate director at the Migration Policy Institute, a research center in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While demographers expected the latest estimates to show a decline in the rate of population growth — the question was simply by how much — some of the changes seen at the state level were a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Midwest was the only region where every state grew in population over the year: For the first time in a decade, more people in the United States moved to the region than left it. Ohio and Michigan both gained population arriving from other states, after seeing residents leave in earlier years. South Carolina was the country’s fastest growing state, followed by Idaho, North Carolina and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, immigration has fueled population growth in the states, and the reduction has dragged it down. There were sharp drops in Texas, New York, Florida and California. The drop in California contributed to an outright decline in population for that state, one of five states to run in the red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Census Bureau estimates are derived from government records, like birth and death certificates and data on immigration and refugees. This year, the bureau also included new sources of information, including government data from Mexico, to get a more accurate count of the number of people leaving the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some demographers have praised these changes and said they will contribute to a more accurate count, they have also cautioned that immigration is difficult to track precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27nat-yale-qljh/27nat-yale-qljh-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale University said on Tuesday that attending the university would be free for newly admitted undergraduate students from families with annual incomes below $100,000, and that tuition would be waived for those earning below $200,000. The change takes effect for the class that will enroll in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move enters Yale into an arms race of elite institutions offering increasingly attractive financial aid packages to students from low- and middle-income families. At Yale, the full-price cost to attend is now more than $90,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale’s new policy essentially matches the deal offered by Harvard last year, which followed similar announcements by the University of Pennsylvania, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beefed-up financial aid follows the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision limiting what universities may do to recruit racially diverse student bodies. The schools hope to continue to attract diverse applicants by stepping up financial aid, since race and income are often correlated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort to make attendance more affordable at some of the nation’s highest-rated universities also comes at a time when public trust in higher education has declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Kahlenberg, director of the American Identity Project at the Progressive Policy Institute, said the effort was good not just for the country but also for Yale, because it will allow students from different walks of life to attend, increasing the range of viewpoints on campus as well as the range of backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Economic diversity can bring racial diversity in a way that’s perfectly legal,” he said. “So after the Supreme Court struck down the use of race, institutions like Yale had to find different ways to get racial diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new policy, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, Yale said that students from 80 percent of households in the United States would qualify for free tuition, and students from almost half the nation’s households would be eligible for an entirely free Yale education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the lowest-income students, the offerings at Yale, Harvard and some other schools include free housing and meal plans, allowances for travel to and from campus, medical insurance and “start-up” grants for students to use to buy books and supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an announcement last August, Princeton appeared to eclipse even those generous aid packages, saying that most families with incomes up to $150,000 would pay nothing to attend and most with incomes up to $250,000 will pay no tuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, the upper limit for household income to qualify for no-cost attendance at Yale was $75,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah Quinlan, Yale’s dean of undergraduate admission and financial aid, said the new plan is an investment in affordability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With this announcement, we reiterate and reinforce Yale’s commitment to ensuring that cost will never be a barrier between promising students and a Yale College education,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27trump-news-norton-vphw/27trump-news-norton-vphw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who has served for three decades as Washington, D.C.’s nonvoting representative in Congress, on Tuesday announced she planned to retire at the end of her term, pivoting after months of insisting she had no intention of stepping aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you to my constituents for choosing and trusting me to fight for you in Congress 18 times,” she said in a statement. “I will leave this institution knowing that I have given you everything I have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 88-year-old Democrat is the oldest person serving in the House. Once a forceful voice for the nation’s capital, she had retreated from her congressional duties in recent years amid signs of mental and physical decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she had repeatedly swatted away the suggestion that she might leave Congress, including as recently as this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, even after her campaign filed a termination notice for her re-election, her office declined to confirm that Ms. Norton planned to retire and she issued no statement, raising questions about whether she had approved the move — or even knew about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Norton, a civil-rights leader and former law professor who entered Congress in 1991, earned the moniker of D.C.’s “warrior on the Hill,” after decades of fighting for statehood for the district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in recent years her voice has diminished on Capitol Hill. She has said little since President Trump’s return to office, even as Republicans wielded their trifecta of power to increase federal control over the city she represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The privilege of public service is inseparable from the responsibility to recognize when it’s time to lift up the next generation of leaders,” Ms. Norton said in her statement on Tuesday. “For D.C., that time has come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her exit will mark the end of a strained final chapter of her congressional career in which Ms. Norton often appeared confused on Capitol Hill, but steadfastly refused to consider ending her long political career. She had become a symbol of the gerontocracy gripping Washington, sitting silent in committee meetings and saying little to push back on Republicans’ legislative attacks on the district and the deployment of the National Guard to police the city’s streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former top staff member, Trent Holbrook, and several members of the D.C. Council had already announced plans to run for her seat even before Ms. Norton announced she was stepping down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Democrats praised her for decades of work fighting for the rights of D.C. voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eleanor fought with deep patriotism for the people of the District of Columbia, honoring the history and promise of Washington while never wavering in her demand for justice,” former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement that Ms. Norton had been “a guiding force for our members for decades, sharing her wisdom and expertise and helping to shape generations of leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington said in a statement on Sunday that the congresswoman’s work “embodies the unwavering resolve of a city that refuses to yield in its fight for equal representation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/03/11/multimedia/27xp-border/11budget-border-btpv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Arizona man was in critical condition after exchanging gunfire with a U.S. Border Patrol agent and shooting at a federal helicopter on Tuesday in Arizona near the Mexican border, the authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Border Patrol agents were working to apprehend a male suspect in an “active alien smuggling matter” when he shot at a federal helicopter, Heith Janke, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s Phoenix field office, said during a news conference late Tuesday afternoon. Federal agents returned fire and shot the suspect, Mr. Janke said. No federal agents were injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams from the Santa Rita Fire District of Green Valley, Ariz., and American Medical Response, which provides emergency medical services, were dispatched to the reported shooting around milepost 15 on West Arivaca Road, just after 7:30 a.m., the fire district said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crews found “one patient in custody and in critical condition,” and provided medical care before the patient was airlifted to a regional trauma center, the fire district said. The federal agent involved in the shooting also rendered aid for the man, Mr. Janke said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man, Patrick Gary Schlegel, 34, of Sahuarita, Ariz., was transported to the hospital and underwent surgery, Mr. Janke said. He is recovering but remains in serious condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Schlegel has a significant criminal history, including an active federal arrest warrant, and is in federal custody, Mr. Janke said. He is expected to be charged with assault on a federal officer, alien smuggling and being a felon in possession of a firearm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let me be clear: Any assault on law enforcement officers will not be tolerated,” he said. “The F.B.I. will continue to vigorously investigate those who harm or threaten to do harm to those who wear the badge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal agents had seen the vehicle that Mr. Schlegel was driving before 7 a.m. with other passengers. When agents tried to stop the vehicle, which was believed to be involved in human smuggling, “everybody fled, the vehicle fled,” Sheriff Chris Nanos of Pima County said during the news conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the morning, an agent saw the vehicle again and made a second traffic stop in the area of Arivaca Road, he said. The driver fled, Sheriff Nanos said, and the Border Patrol agent gave chase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said it was working with the F.B.I. and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the Border Patrol, on the case. The department said the F.B.I. had asked it to lead the investigation into the use of force involving the agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a news release, the department said it “will thoroughly examine all aspects of the incident, however, these investigations are complex and require time.” It appears that the Border Patrol agent who shot Mr. Schlegel acted lawfully, Sheriff Nanos said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Border Patrol and its parent agency, Customs and Border Protection, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arivaca Road is about 25 miles from the international border and about 20 miles from the center of Arivaca, an unincorporated community in Arizona. The region and its checkpoints have been a focus of border enforcement for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Customs and Border Protection said a Border Patrol agent “was involved in a use-of-force incident while investigating a human smuggling event” near the Santa Cruz and Pima Counties line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, a shooting by a Border Patrol agent wounded one person near Arivaca, one of two shootings in a week that capped a string of drug seizures by the patrol, The Arizona Daily Star reported that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrutiny of the nation’s immigration debate has been heightened in recent months with the Trump administration crackdown turning violent in Minneapolis, including the fatal shootings of two people by federal officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27minneapolis-ice-liam1/27minneapolis-ice-liam1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked the deportation of a 5-year-old boy and his father who were arrested in a Minneapolis suburb in an operation that further stirred the outrage over the Trump administration’s deportation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, were arrested last week in Columbia Heights, Minn., shortly after the father had picked the boy up from school, according to school district officials. They were quickly taken to an immigration detention center outside San Antonio, where they remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his order, Judge Fred Biery of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas told the federal government that it could not move the boy or his father out of his court’s jurisdiction while they challenged their detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detention of the boy and his father by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents became a flashpoint in the Twin Cities, where anger has continued to grow over the surge of federal agents in the region. The image of Liam, wearing a Spider-Man backpack and a large winter hat as he was detained by federal agents, quickly became emblematic of the harsh effects of the government’s tactics in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly what happened during the arrest remains in dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials with the Columbia Heights Public School District, where Liam is a prekindergarten student, accused the federal government of using the boy as bait at his home to try to lure other family members out of the house. They said he was one of four students in the district who had recently been detained by the immigration authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Department of Homeland Security officials said that Mr. Conejo Arias had fled from agents, leaving Liam behind, and that Liam’s mother had “refused to accept custody” of him. They said Mr. Conejo Arias had told agents that he wanted Liam to remain with him. They also said that agents had not targeted or arrested the child, though they said he was being held with his father at an immigration detention center in Dilley, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security Department spokeswoman, maintained on Tuesday that Mr. Conejo Arias, who is from Ecuador, had entered the country illegally in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for the father and son disputed that in court documents, saying that the pair had entered legally at a border crossing in Brownsville, Texas. The lawyer, Jennifer Scarborough, said they had followed the government’s guidelines for asylum seekers and argued that the government had violated the rights of the father and his son by detaining them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order from Judge Biery, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, was brief and did not delve into the details of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a news conference at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul on Tuesday, school district officials and lawmakers decried the impact that immigration arrests were having on students. Of the four students arrested in Columbia Heights, two were detained on their way to school, said Mary Granlund, who chairs the Board of Education there. Another student was getting ready for school when there was a knock on the door from immigration agents, Ms. Granlund said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Granlund and others said the district, which has about 3,400 students, was in a crisis, with students staying home from school, children crying in classrooms and teachers not being able to give answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Children ask, ‘Can they take us?’ We don’t know what to tell them,” said Peg Nelson, a teacher in Columbia Heights. “Every day we wonder: How long is this sustainable?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top three House Democrats on Tuesday came out in support of an effort to impeach Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, part of a growing chorus in the party calling for Ms. Noem’s ouster after federal immigration agents shot and killed two people in Minneapolis this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, Representatives Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Pete Aguilar of California called for “dramatic changes” at the Homeland Security Department and accused officials of carrying out a violent “killing spree.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kristi Noem should be fired immediately, or we will commence impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives,” they wrote. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 150 congressional Democrats have now joined the bid to impeach Ms. Noem. The effort would need Republican support to move forward, and, so far, no G.O.P. lawmaker has called for the secretary’s removal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the leadership’s statement was a strong indication that Democrats would move to impeach Ms. Noem if they won the majority in the midterm elections, and that many of them, across the ideological spectrum, are prepared to campaign on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the party would begin preparing for eventual impeachment proceedings, with or without Republican support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, he said that he and other leading Democrats would start “a complete oversight and impeachment inquiry into all potential constitutional crimes committed by Secretary Noem” if Republicans failed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 162 House Democrats — about three-quarters of the total caucus — have backed a resolution to impeach Ms. Noem, according to a spokeswoman for Representative Robin Kelly, who introduced the resolution earlier this month. That is 51 more than had signed on as cosponsors to Ms. Kelly’s measure as of Friday, the last day the House met for legislative business and the day before Mr. Pretti was killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jeffries, Ms. Clark and Mr. Aguilar have yet to sign on as co-sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though many Senate Democrats have called for Ms. Noem to resign or be fired, a smaller number in that chamber have called for her to be impeached. They include Senators Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Peter Welch of Vermont, and Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kristi Noem should resign,” Ms. Warren said in a video posted on social media platforms. “And if she doesn’t, Congress should impeach her and remove her from office.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27-nat-virginia-redistricting-jzhc/27-nat-virginia-redistricting-jzhc-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state judge in Virginia issued an order on Tuesday blocking the Democratic-led legislature from drawing new district maps for the 2026 congressional elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling, which found that Democratic lawmakers had not followed state law on redistricting, could be a major setback to the party’s attempt to counter President Trump’s push for the drawing of favorable new districts in Republican-held states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic leaders, who had been anticipating a legal fight, immediately said that they would appeal the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This jockeying over congressional maps began in Texas last year, at the president’s urging, as he sought to ensure that Republicans would maintain their very slim majority in the House in the midterm elections this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Texas launched the first salvo of partisan gerrymandering, North Carolina and Missouri, both states with Republican legislatures, have also adopted new maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counter-effort in some Democratic-held states, including Virginia and California, was more complicated, requiring constitutional amendments required to allow the legislatures to redraw congressional districts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters in California approved such an amendment in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Virginia, a new constitutional amendment must be voted on by the legislature twice, before and after an “intervening” statewide election, and then put to voters in a referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last October, Democratic leaders in the General Assembly announced they were calling the legislature back to Richmond as part of an ongoing special session, which had been first called by the governor in 2024 to consider budget matters. Democrats then introduced the topic of the session: a resolution that would allow the legislature to draw new maps in time for the 2026 midterms. It was passed on a party-line vote, less than week before Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Democrats passed the resolution for the required second time and this week, the legislature was holding votes to schedule the referendum for April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the ruling on Tuesday, by Judge Jack S. Hurley Jr. of Tazewell County Circuit Court in southwest Virginia, has, for now, thrown the redistricting effort into question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans had raised objections as soon as the resolution was introduced. They argued that the vote was too late to count for the required “intervening” election, given that hundreds of thousands of people had already been to the polls in early voting. They also pointed to an old Virginia law requiring proposed amendments be “posted at the front door of every Courthouse” at least three months before a statewide election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats had responded to some of these arguments in debates about the bill on the floor of the legislature. They argued that last November’s election was the required “intervening election.” They also said that the law requiring the posting of amendments on courthouse doors was outdated and obsolete and that was why a state commission had recommended that it be deleted from the legal code last year. Lawyers for the Democrats argued in court that blocking the amendment would be a violation of the separation of powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Hurley sided with the Republicans on nearly all of their arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, State Senator Ryan McDougle and Delegate Terry Kilgore, both Republicans and plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said the case was “about process, fairness, and the simple principle that you cannot change the Constitution by ignoring the Constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic leaders said they would continue “to move forward and put this matter directly to the voters. Republicans who can’t win at the ballot box are abusing the legal process in an attempt to sow confusion and block Virginians from voting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine progressive prosecutors from cities around the country are launching a coalition to assist in prosecuting federal law enforcement officers who violate state laws, one of the prosecutors, Larry Krasner in Philadelphia, said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization, which is called the Project for the Fight Against Federal Overreach, will also include Mary Moriarty, the elected prosecutor in Minneapolis. Its acronym, F.A.F.O., references a slang term for negative consequences, and its formation was spurred by “growing concerns about warrantless entries, unlawful detentions, and coercive enforcement tactics by federal agents,” according to a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handling of potentially criminal actions by federal agents has become a major issue in Minneapolis after two protesters, both U.S. citizens, were killed there this month by Department of Homeland Security officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not investigate the first killing, of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three. She was killed in her S.U.V. on Jan. 7 as she appeared to be steering away from federal agents during a tense confrontation. Trump administration officials said that the officer who shot Ms. Good had been under attack and was acting in self-defense, and state investigators have been blocked from accessing evidence related to the episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a second resident was killed — Alex Pretti, a Veteran Affairs nurse who was also 37 — federal officials initially appeared to use the same playbook. They blocked state investigators from the scene and declined to provide basic facts, like the identity of the agents involved. In both instances, bystander video contradicted key elements of the Trump administration’s account of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing a wave of criticism, President Trump on Tuesday promised a “very honorable and honest investigation” into Mr. Pretti’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As videos and reports of ICE officers acting with aggressive force have flooded the country, a small but growing number of law enforcement officials have warned that they would arrest and prosecute federal officials who break their laws. One of the first to do so was the district attorney in San Francisco, Brooke Jenkins, after the president threatened to send National Guard troops there last October. In Minneapolis, protesters have demanded that the local police arrest ICE officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, John Choi, the top prosecutor in Ramsey County, which includes St. Paul, said his office was investigating reports of crimes by federal agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump administration officials say that ICE officers are making cities safer by removing criminals from the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice’s Office of Civil Rights determine whether the use of deadly force by a federal agent was justified. State prosecutors also have the power to investigate and prosecute state crimes like murder, and they have often done so in cooperation with the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that cooperation has broken down as Trump administration officials have denied that the federal agents committed any wrongdoing and accused Minnesota leaders of thwarting their immigration enforcement efforts and allowing fraud in federally funded programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After local officials were blocked from the investigations, Ms. Moriarty, the elected prosecutor for Hennepin County, resorted to opening a web portal to allow the public to submit evidence like cellphone videos. She has said that she expects to have enough evidence to decide whether to pursue charges in the two killings. Her office is also investigating a third incident in which a Venezuelan man was shot in the leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecuting any police officer raises significant obstacles, since officers are authorized to use deadly force when they reasonably perceive a serious threat. The Constitution’s supremacy clause gives federal agents additional protection, though they do not have absolute immunity, as Vice President JD Vance initially claimed. They can ask for a federal court to shield them from prosecution if their actions were authorized under federal law, and if they can show that they did “no more than what was necessary and proper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Krasner said the new organization would provide “mutual support” to prosecutors who are “up against the might of the federal government.” So far, nine prosecutors from around the country have signed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a very substantial tool against what I consider to be a pretty clear attempt to normalize fascism and to overthrow democracy in the United States,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other locations whose elected prosecutors are participating include Austin; Dallas; Pima County in Arizona, which includes Tucson; and several cities in Virginia: Fairfax, Falls Church and Arlington, Portsmouth and Norfolk.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the weekend, the president demanded that local officials expedite rebuilding permits and ordered an audit of federal funds. But he was silent on the region’s stalled request for $34 billion in federal aid.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27dc-memo-wkmg/27dc-memo-wkmg-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demands for independent investigations. Scheduled oversight hearings. Overtures for proposed concessions to avert a government shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by a federal agent in Minneapolis, Republicans in Congress have starkly shifted their tone on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, offering some of the strongest and most pointed criticism of the administration since the start of President Trump’s second term and conceding that something must change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Pretti’s killing over the weekend had drawn notable pushback from a small but significant group of G.O.P. lawmakers even before Mr. Trump switched rhetorical gears, distancing himself from his administration’s smears of Mr. Pretti and installing a new commander to oversee his deportation push in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for a much broader group of Republicans who have been reluctant to challenge Mr. Trump or even gently criticize him, the president’s messaging pivot appeared to have provided license to air grave concerns about what happened in Minneapolis and the backlash it had generated among much of the American public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift could be temporary and may be more of a matter of style over substance. It was not clear whether it would yield any immediate action by Republicans, who have largely ceded their power to Mr. Trump and who still solidly back his immigration policy. They have balked at Democrats’ demands to drop funding for the Department of Homeland Security bill from a spending package needed to avert a government shutdown on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, Republicans have toned down the hyperpartisan language typical in the run-up to a shutdown. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, signaled openness on Tuesday to negotiating with Democrats on policy changes that might draw their votes for the homeland security spending measure, as he called for a full and impartial investigation into Mr. Pretti’s killing, which he described as “an inflection point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all reflected a worry among congressional Republicans, shared by the president, that voters are souring on the immigration crackdown as they see a federal agency acting far beyond the limits of a police force — and that the party may pay a political price for it in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after months of standing on the sidelines as Democrats and municipal and state leaders railed against the tactics of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other border agencies, Republicans have moved quickly this week to put the agency and Mr. Trump’s policy under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Representative Andrew Garbarino, the New York Republican who leads the House Homeland Security Committee, announced that top administration immigration officials would testify before the panel on Feb. 10 after Mr. Garbarino called for their appearance immediately after Mr. Pretti’s killing on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Transparency and communication are needed to turn the temperature down,” Mr. Garbarino said in setting the date for the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican who heads his chamber’s homeland security panel, announced a similar session on Feb. 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another sign of Republican unease with the immigration push, Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada, who leads the spending panel responsible for the Homeland Security Department’s funding, criticized Secretary Kristi Noem’s response to the shootings in an interview with The Nevada Independent. He said a “pivot” in immigration enforcement tactics was necessary “because regardless of what side of immigration enforcement you’re on, we are not in a good place right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican who has announced his retirement, went further on Tuesday, becoming the first in his party to call for Ms. Noem’s firing. “What she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying,” he said at the Capitol, adding, “She needs to go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the House, Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York, leaders of the Problem Solvers Caucus, wrote to Mr. Trump asking for a meeting to discuss a broad immigration overhaul, because his border successes “are now being overshadowed by the interior enforcement that has given rise to a growing rejection by the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those actions followed calls by several Senate Republicans — some of whom have never previously questioned the administration’s actions — for an independent investigation into the killings in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top Republicans are also taking a different approach to the intensifying clash with Senate Democrats over funding for the Department of Homeland Security as a partial government shutdown looms at the end of the week. Democrats are demanding tough new limits on federal immigration agents or they will oppose homeland security funding that is part of a six-bill spending package set for an initial vote on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than immediately accusing Democrats of acting irresponsibly and putting government services at risk, Republican leaders have taken a softer approach and have said they hope a resolution can be reached in talks between Democrats and the White House. It is a stark contrast from the last shutdown, when Republicans refused to even enter into negotiations on Democrats’ key demand, extending health care subsidies, until they agreed to end the shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think the question is, ‘What is it the Democrats want?’” Mr. Thune said as the Senate returned on Tuesday. “And if they can define that, then we should figure out if there’s a way to actually achieve it, or come to some agreement, if you will, to negotiate whatever their demands are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added, “Obviously this is an inflection point, an opportunity to evaluate and to really assess the policies and the procedures” of the Trump administration in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all Republicans are dialing it down. In a statement on Tuesday posted on X, the members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus urged Mr. Trump to keep the immigration pressure on, illustrating how difficult it could be to secure House approval of any changes won by Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We support @POTUS doing whatever is necessary to keep American streets safe from rapists, murderers, and pedophiles here illegally,” the Freedom Caucus statement said. “If Democrat-run Sanctuary Cities continue enabling Communist agitators assaulting ICE and federal law enforcement, then it is time to invoke the Insurrection Act to maintain law and order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Senate Republicans took a similar stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Four months ago, Democrats shut down the government in an attempt to give illegal aliens free health care,” Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, wrote on X. “Now, they want to shut down the government to stop illegal aliens from being deported. Do Democrats work for the American people or illegal aliens?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Thune’s comments suggested that Senate leaders were still hopeful for a resolution that could avoid a shutdown. Whether the more measured approach would result in real action that could change the administration’s tactics or avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the week remained an open question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Senate Republicans said Democrats should cut a deal with Mr. Trump for whatever policy changes they wanted to see in exchange for voting for the spending package, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, threw cold water on that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fix should come from Congress,” Mr. Schumer said on Tuesday as he again called for Mr. Thune to break off the homeland security funding measure and allow the Senate to approve funding for the rest of the government while lawmakers negotiated new restrictions on immigration enforcement. “The public can’t trust the administration to do the right thing on its own. The Republicans and Democrats must work together to make that happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Schumer also made it clear that he was not impressed with a tonal shift by Republicans and the president and that he wanted immediate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What ICE is doing is state-sanctioned thuggery and it must be stopped,” he said. “ICE must leave Minnesota today. Not tomorrow, not next week, but today.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27dc-trump-fbpk/27dc-trump-fbpk-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump said on Tuesday that “we’re going to de-escalate a little bit” when it comes to his immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, the latest indication that the mounting backlash to the fatal shooting of a protester Saturday had prompted him to try to shift perceptions of the administration’s approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump did not specify what tactics being used by federal immigration agents would change, if any. And he continued to blame Alex Pretti, the intensive care unit nurse shot by Border Patrol agents, for legally carrying a gun with a permit — comments that risked angering gun rights supporters in his base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can’t walk in with guns,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for a speech in Iowa about the economy. “You can’t do that,” he added, before calling Mr. Pretti’s death “a very unfortunate incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president also acknowledged the aggressive tactics of Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official known for his confrontational style who was pulled out of Minneapolis. In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump described him as “a pretty out there kind of guy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In some cases it’s good,” the president said. “Maybe it’s not good here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallout from Mr. Pretti’s killing on a frozen Minneapolis street Saturday shadowed the president’s attempts to focus on the economy during a speech to supporters in Clive, Iowa, an event meant to serve as a kickoff for his broader campaign to bolster Republicans in the midterm elections. Outside the Horizon Events Center before the appearance, thousands of protesters blew whistles, beat drums and chanted “ICE out now!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his address, Mr. Trump did not mention the shooting. But he kept up his hard-edge attacks on immigrants, lines that got the loudest cheers of the night. At one point, he raised the specter of immigrants who may “blow up our shopping centers, blow up our farms, kill people.” He also falsely portrayed the vast majority of those detained by ICE in Minnesota and elsewhere as hardened criminals, asserting that once those people were removed, crime would be nearly eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Capitol Hill Tuesday, the top three House Democrats came out in support of an effort to impeach Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary — part of a growing chorus in the party calling for her ouster after the deaths of two protesters in Minneapolis in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans were also critical. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who is retiring at the end of his term, told reporters that Ms. Noem should be fired, and called her actions “amateurish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska struck a similar note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have a secretary right now who needs to be accountable to the chaos and some of the tragedy that we have seen,” Ms. Murkowski told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day, reflecting the competing pressures he was under from aides who wanted to stay the course and from Republicans who joined the criticism of the administration’s tactics, Mr. Trump kept hedging his comments. During the Fox News interview, he insisted: “I don’t think this is a pullback.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the president also said that “we’re going to de-escalate a little bit.” He noted that he had dispatched his border czar, Tom Homan, to take over the operation in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump also told reporters that he did not believe Mr. Pretti was a potential “assassin,” the term used by his close aide, Stephen Miller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Mr. Pretti’s killing, the president has repeatedly questioned why the protester was carrying a gun as he was observing Border Patrol agents conducting an operation. (Mr. Trump has not made similar comments about incidents in which his supporters have carried weapons, including during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar rhetoric in recent days by top administration officials has drawn condemnation from gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump insisted Tuesday that he was awaiting a “very honorable and honest investigation” into the shooting. That investigation is being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agents who were involved in Mr. Pretti’s shooting. Ms. Noem was also among the first and most insistent to declare that Mr. Pretti had violent motives, saying he had arrived on the scene with the intention to “inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No evidence has emerged to support that assertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details that have emerged in court filings so far indicate that the Department of Homeland Security probe is limited to a “use of force” review, rather than a broader inquiry that would examine whether the agents should face criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Iowa, Mr. Trump tried to change the topic, appearing at a rally where he was surrounded by supporters holding signs that said “Lower Prices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Incomes are up, prices are down, our economy is roaring,” the president declared. “Our workers are thriving and our country is winning again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has frequently claimed that prices are declining, though federal statistics show that the inflation rate — while slowing from several years ago — is hovering around 2.7 percent. He claimed that he had inherited “the highest inflation rate in the history of our country,” though that statement was false — something he seemed to acknowledge almost immediately, correcting himself to say it was the highest in “48 years.” (In fact, the highest was more than a century ago, at the end of World War I, when the inflation rate hit 23 percent.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans in Congress, also eager to turn the conversation away from the fatal shooting in Minneapolis, spent much of the day Tuesday seeking to remind voters who would soon file tax returns about the tax cuts their party had pushed through Congress in their marquee domestic policy bill last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaker Mike Johnson, who as of Tuesday afternoon had not put out a statement responding to Mr. Pretti’s death, took to social media proclaiming: “MORE MONEY IS BEING RETURNED TO YOU.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s what happens when Republicans are in charge and we put AMERICANS first,” Mr. Johnson wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior-most Republican in the chamber, delivered a triumphal speech from the Senate floor, saying: “This year taxpayers can expect to see some of the largest tax refunds in history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That, of course, is thanks to our enactment of the legislation called the Working Families Tax Act,” Mr. Grassley said, referring to the legislation that Mr. Trump had insisted on calling the “Big Beautiful Bill.” Republicans have since rebranded that law after polling showed that voters had a negative opinion of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis held separate meetings on Tuesday with President Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, a day after he was dispatched by the president to direct ICE operations in the state in the wake of the killing of Alex Pretti by federal agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Pretti was the second Minneapolis resident in the past three weeks to be killed, and the third to be shot, by federal agents engaged in the administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Homan’s meetings with the governor and mayor came amid Mr. Trump’s struggles to contain the fallout over the killing and his administration’s false accusations about Mr. Pretti, a Veterans Affairs nurse who was shot repeatedly by agents in South Minneapolis on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Walz’s office said in a statement that he and Mr. Homan had met in St. Paul on Tuesday and that the two had agreed to continue working toward the state’s goals: a swift reduction in federal forces on the ground, impartial investigations into Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents and “an end to the campaign of retribution against Minnesota.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Frey said in a series of social media posts that he and his police chief, Brian O’Hara, had also spoken with Mr. Homan on Tuesday, calling their meeting “productive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I reiterated that my main ask is for Operation Metro Surge to end as quickly as possible,” Mr. Frey said, referring to the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement campaign in Minneapolis, during which some 3,000 federal agents have flooded Minnesota, making thousands of arrests and prompting mass protests, street confrontations and widespread fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Frey said he had made clear that Minneapolis would continue to prohibit city employees, including police officers, from enforcing federal immigration law, but he added that city leaders would “stay in conversation with Mr. Homan and his team.” Mr. Walz’s office said in its statement that the Minnesota Department of Public Safety would be the state’s primary liaison to Mr. Homan. The president has said Mr. Homan will report directly to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the meetings on social media, Mr. Homan said that he met with Mr. Walz and Mr. Frey to talk about the need to support law enforcement officers and get criminals off the streets. “While we don’t agree on everything, these meetings were a productive starting point and I look forward to more conversations with key stakeholders in the days ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to reach Mr. Homan for additional comment were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks with Mr. Homan came one day after Mr. Trump said he’d had “very good” calls with Mr. Walz and Mr. Frey. Later on Monday, he met for nearly two hours in the Oval Office with Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, and her top aide, Corey Lewandowski, according to two people briefed on the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump’s decision to send Mr. Homan to Minnesota is part of a shake-up that, according to two federal officials, will include Gregory Bovino, who has led the Border Patrol’s operations in Minneapolis, leaving the city. Mr Bovino’s aggressive tactics in major American cities have made him a face of the White House’s immigration crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bovino is “a pretty out there kind of guy,” Mr. Trump said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday. “In some cases it’s good, maybe it’s not good here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same interview, Mr. Trump described Mr. Homan, a longtime immigration enforcement official who played a central role in implementing the Trump administration’s family separation policy during the president’s first term, as a “tough guy” who nevertheless got along well with governors and mayors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one sure sign that the Trump administration understands it is in trouble with the public this week: They didn’t just recall Gregory Bovino from Minnesota. They silenced him on social media, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the unacquainted, Mr. Bovino is the great-coat-wearing border patrol “commander-at-large” who led the operation in Minneapolis and became the face of the mayhem. It was a role he leaned into online, posting prolifically from his X account, @CMDROpAtLargeCA, right up until Monday morning, when the account appeared to go dormant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Convicted sexual predator arrested!” read his last post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to bar Mr. Bovino from his account was made not by the White House but by his higher-ups at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, according to an official at the Department of Homeland Security. A different U.S. official insisted that Mr. Bovino would eventually regain access to his social media account, once he’s back at his previous post in California, overseeing part of the border there. Both asked for anonymity because they were not allowed to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the taming of CMDROpAtLargeCA offered a glimpse into an administration in damage control mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to be demoted. It is another thing entirely to lose your social media megaphone. In this administration, there may be no worse fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump rules by social media and it’s difficult to be a power player in his court if you’re not power posting, too. To lose one’s account is to lose the ability to brag about all the righteous work one does for him. It means losing the ability to tar one’s common enemy. How is one supposed to build a profile within the MAGA universe if one cannot post?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bovino, 55, seemed to understand all of this. He used his X account to mix it up with journalists, lawmakers, critics, fans, Stephen King — whoever. CMDROpAtLargeCA became an expression of the persona he crafted for himself, every bit as important as the coat and the haircut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bovino could be blasé about the bloodshed on American streets. “Pipe down with the feigned outrage,” he wrote to Democratic representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who posted a video condemning the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. When Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona, posted about Mr. Pretti’s death, Mr. Bovino replied: “You were there? Typical arm chair quarterback.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it became clear that Mr. Bovino would be the one to take the fall, it was somehow surprising that he would be suspended from social media. There was really nothing about his behavior online that wasn’t perfectly in keeping with how his superiors behave online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, is a social media warrior. Vice President JD Vance has been crashing out online about Minneapolis all week. Stephen Miller, the architect of the administration’s immigration policies, called Mr. Pretti a “would-be assassin” in a post on X. These officials have posted things that are in direct contradiction to what the president and his press secretary are now saying about the violence in Minneapolis, and yet, this does not seem to have hurt them at work. Mr. Miller was traveling with the president aboard Air Force One to Iowa Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to imagine what was off-kilter about the way Mr. Bovino was using social media. After all, the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, the Labor Department and other sectors of this administration have spent the year posting references to neo-Nazi literature, QAnon conspiracy theories and white-supremacist song lyrics on official government accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A White House official declined to comment about Mr. Bovino’s social media account Tuesday.His social media suspension has raised a collective eyebrow on the right, as social media censorship has long been one of most animating causes for members of the president’s political base. One of the main consequences of Mr. Trump’s actions on Jan. 6, 2021, was that he was kicked off social media platforms. He started his own platform, Truth Social, which is a key part of how he governs today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several prominent posters with connections to the administration preferred not to comment about the silencing of Mr. Bovino when asked about it on Tuesday. One who did want to comment was Steve Bannon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Silencing Commander Bovino is a terrible idea,” he wrote in a text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might Laura Loomer think? It was only a few years ago that she had been banned by so many platforms that, she once said, she had to go to therapy because of the “PTSD I have developed as a result of being silenced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, she functions as a combination mouthpiece and loyalty enforcer for the Trump administration. So maybe it shouldn’t have come as a surprise that she didn’t seem too concerned about Mr. Bovino being shut up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So from what I was told by the White House when I asked about this is that he’s going to have another social media account, but for the El Centro sector,” she said, referring to the part of California to which Mr. Bovino has been reassigned. “It’s not that he’s being shut down or silenced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another power poster in the Trump orbit is Katie Miller, the former administration aide who is married to Stephen Miller. Ms. Miller said she hadn’t been paying attention to the commotion around Mr. Bovino’s suspension and therefore couldn’t be sure if it was true. “I don’t follow him even,” she said. She said she didn’t know what he had or had not been posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My algo doesn’t show him, unfortunately,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now neither does yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27trump-news-iraq-lgwk/27trump-news-iraq-lgwk-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump on Tuesday warned that the United States would “no longer help Iraq” if Nuri Kamal al-Maliki returned as Iraq’s prime minister, a new intervention in another country’s politics that came after Washington signaled it would seek to limit Iranian influence in Iraq’s next government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just over the last few days, Mr. Trump has threatened Canada over doing business with China and vowed to raise tariffs on South Korea because of delays in fulfilling a trade deal with the United States. Last week, Mr. Trump walked back a pledge to raise tariffs on European countries that were resisting his efforts to take over Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Iraq, where Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani fell short of a decisive victory in elections last November, is far more vulnerable to American threats. The United States controls Iraq’s oil revenues because they flow through the New York Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No Iraqi prime minister is viable if the Americans say, ‘We’re going to hate this guy from Minute 1,’” said Michael Knights, an Iraq specialist at Horizon Engage, a strategic consulting firm in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Maliki was nominated to the prime minister post by the main Shiite Muslim bloc in the Iraqi Parliament on Saturday. He was backed by the United States when he first became prime minister in 2006 but was blamed in his second term, from 2010 to 2014, for sectarian policies that fueled the rise of the Islamic State, a Sunni extremist group. Iraq, like Iran, is a majority Shiite nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos,” Mr. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday. “Because of his insane policies and ideologies, if elected, the United States of America will no longer help Iraq and, if we are not there to help, Iraq has ZERO chance of Success, Prosperity, or Freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump’s broadside against Mr. Maliki came after months of building U.S. pressure against Iranian influence in Iraq. Iraq’s leaders have long had to walk a tightrope between the United States on one hand and Iran, their powerful neighbor, on the other. Iran has ties to many leading figures in Iraq’s Shiite majority, including Mr. Maliki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A government controlled by Iran cannot successfully put Iraq’s own interests first,” the State Department said after Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Mr. Sudani, the current prime minister of Iraq, in a phone call on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump did not mention Iran in his Truth Social post, leaving his exact motivations unclear. Mr. Knights said that while Mr. Maliki empowered Iran-linked militias in his second term as prime minister, his actions in recent years did not stand out as particularly pro-Iranian compared with other major Shiite figures in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina, reinforced the administration’s anti-Iran message in a social media post a few hours after Mr. Trump’s missive on Tuesday. He said that Iraq needed to “fully disarm and dismantle all Iranian aligned militia groups” within 12 months and remove Iranian advisers, operatives and agents from the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Iranian influence in Iraq will no longer be tolerated,” Mr. Wilson wrote. “The era in which outside actors imposed prime ministers on Iraq is over.”&lt;/p&gt;

Review Does Not Say Pretti Brandished Gun, As Noem Claimed</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/pretti-shooting-minneapolis-dhs-report.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27minneapolis-ice-DHS-report1-ckpq/27minneapolis-ice-DHS-report1-ckpq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A preliminary review by U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s internal watchdog office found that Alex Pretti was shot by two federal officers after resisting arrest, but did not indicate that he brandished a weapon during the encounter, according to an email sent to Congress and reviewed by The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review makes no mention of the Department of Homeland Security’s earlier claims that Mr. Pretti, a U.S. citizen, “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” Shortly after the shooting, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, claimed that Mr. Pretti had been “brandishing” a gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials had provided no evidence to back up the claim, which was contradicted by witness videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial review by C.B.P., which deployed more than 1,000 officers and agents to support the enforcement operation in Minnesota, represents the first official written assessment of Saturday’s shooting since administration officials rushed to blame Mr. Pretti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These notifications reflect standard Customs and Border Protection protocol and are issued in accordance with existing procedures,” Hilton Beckham, a C.B.P. spokeswoman, said in a statement. “They provide an initial outline of an event that took place and do not convey any definitive conclusion or investigative findings. They are factual reports — not analytical judgments — and are provided to inform Congress and to promote transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review was done by C.B.P.’s Office of Professional Responsibility, which normally conducts internal misconduct investigations following shootings, and was distributed to members of Congress on Tuesday, as required by law. It presents a detailed timeline of the events based on body camera footage and agency documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At approximately 9 a.m. on Saturday, a federal officer was confronted by two female civilians blowing whistles, according to the review. Although the officer ordered them to move out of the road, they did not move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The officer then “pushed them both away,” and one of the women ran to Mr. Pretti, the review said. After the officer attempted to move them out of the road and they did not move, the officer deployed pepper spray at them, according to the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Pretti then resisted attempts by C.B.P. officers to take him into custody, prompting a struggle, the review said. A Border Patrol agent multiple times yelled, “He’s got a gun!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About five seconds later, a Border Patrol agent fired his Glock 19, and a C.B.P. officer also fired his Glock 47 at Mr. Pretti, according to the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York Times analysis of video footage from the scene found that officers fired 10 shots, including six after Mr. Pretti was lying motionless on the ground. Mr. Pretti had been disarmed before he was shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government review said that after the shooting, a Border Patrol agent “advised he had possession of Pretti’s firearm” and “subsequently cleared and secured Pretti’s firearm in his vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At approximately 9:02 a.m., C.B.P. personnel cut Mr. Pretti’s clothing and provided medical aid to him by placing chest seals on his wounds, according to the review. About three minutes later, local emergency medical services arrived at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Pretti was placed in an ambulance and transported to Hennepin County Medical Center before medical personnel pronounced him dead at approximately 9:32 a.m., the review said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, President Trump faulted Mr. Pretti, who had a firearms permit, for bringing a gun to protest the enforcement operation. It is legal to openly carry a weapon in Minnesota. Still, Mr. Trump promised a “very honorable and honest investigation” into his killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C.B.P.’s Office of Professional Responsibility has a large investigative program to look into officer-involved shootings and other potential officer misconduct. Basic incident reports like the one distributed on Tuesday are required to be released within 72 hours of an officer shooting. But those are often followed by investigations from internal staff members, typically alongside F.B.I. officials conducting a review to see if criminal charges are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review says instead that Homeland Security Investigations, an arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is investigating the incident while O.P.R. reviews those findings. The decision to have Homeland Security Investigations take the lead has provoked some consternation from former O.P.R. leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement on LinkedIn posted Tuesday morning, Daniel Altman and Matthew Klein, two former officials at the watchdog office who left the department last year, called on the administration to allow O.P.R. to do an internal review and the F.B.I. to conduct a criminal investigation into whether the officers violated civil rights laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said that Homeland Security Investigations “does not have the mandate or expertise to conduct civil-rights use-of-force investigations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Altman and Mr. Klein were also critical of the initial rush to judgment by administration officials and called for more transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Public confidence has already been damaged,” they wrote. “Transparency — through disciplined, sequenced release of investigative findings — allows the public to judge the results for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27minneapolis-ice-trump-speech-wpbv/27minneapolis-ice-trump-speech-wpbv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking in Iowa on Tuesday at a rally billed as an address on the economy, President Trump veered near the end into a tirade in which he vilified the thousands of people arrested by ICE in Minnesota, falsely describing them as “hardened, vicious, horrible criminals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising the specter of immigrants who may “blow up our shopping centers, blow up our farms, kill people,” Mr. Trump asserted while speaking near Des Moines that “2 percent of the population causes 90 percent of the crime.” He added, “So when you start decimating that 2 percent, boom,” miming a falling gesture with one finger as he spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, most of the immigrants that ICE has arrested in city crackdowns since Mr. Trump took office have no criminal record. In Washington, which Mr. Trump characterized in his speech as a “horrible,” crime-ridden city before his recent show of force, only 2 percent of those arrested by ICE had been convicted of a violent crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Hogan, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, criticized Mr. Trump’s rhetoric toward detained migrants as dangerous, saying that voters will hold him accountable in November’s midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At a time when our entire nation is reeling from multiple tragedies in Minnesota, Donald Trump continues to pour gasoline on the fire,” Mr. Hogan said, adding “He knows damn well that his lies sow chaos, but he does it anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dark turn in Mr. Trump’s language came amid a growing outcry against his administration’s show of force in Minnesota. After suggesting to Fox News earlier on Tuesday that he might “de-escalate” the crackdown, he then pushed back on the idea that any change in approach in Minnesota was a retreat, attacking anti-ICE demonstrators as “paid insurrectionists” and “paid agitators.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He returned to that language in his speech. Mr. Trump was heckled throughout the address and outside the rally venue by people he described as “lunatics.” A crowd lined up for blocks along the president’s motorcade route, blowing whistles, beating drums and chanting “ICE out now!” A woman attending the rally screamed, “Release the files,” presumably referring to the Epstein files, and was being escorted out. A young man was dragged out by security officers for heckling the president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They get paid,” Mr. Trump said as the man was removed. “These are all paid agitators, that’s all they are. They get paid to go and — they don’t even know when they interview them. ‘Why are you here? I don’t know.’ They have no idea. They’re paid insurrectionists, really, in some cases. They’re sickos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Mr. Trump’s sidetrack, he had delivered an unusually focused hourlong speech, campaigning for the midterms and seeking to counter criticism of his tariffs and the rising cost of goods. In recent months, when Mr. Trump has been frustrated by continuing criticism over the state of the economy, he has vacillated between blaming immigrants for the country’s economic woes and assuring his supporters that life has been better than ever under his administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump repeated many of his false claims about the economy on Tuesday. He falsely said that he had eliminated taxes on Social Security, when he has not. He said that his administration had collected $600 billion in tariff revenue, when in reality the sum is $287 billion. And he claimed that prices for groceries and pharmaceutical drugs were falling, but the reverse is true: Drug prices are still rising and prices for groceries are now rising faster than during any month since October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27minneapolis-ice-Omarattack-vpkf/27minneapolis-ice-Omarattack-vpkf-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a town hall with Representative Ilhan Omar in Minneapolis on Tuesday evening, a man rushed the lectern and appeared to spray her with a strong-smelling liquid before he was tackled by security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man, who had been seated directly in front of the lectern in the front row, suddenly jumped up as Ms. Omar was speaking and ran toward the podium. He used a syringe to spray her shirt with a substance that smelled strongly of vinegar. As he stumbled backward and pointed at her, a security officer tackled him to the ground, handcuffed him and removed him from the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasps were audible through the crowd, as well as cries of “Oh my God, oh my God.” Some attendees yelled out, “He sprayed something!” A woman in the crowd appeared near tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minneapolis Police said the man, whom they later identified as Anthony J. Kazmierczak, 55, was arrested and booked into jail on suspicion of assault. A forensics squad was called to analyze the scene, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Omar, a Democrat who represents part of Minneapolis and has been a frequent target of President Trump, held the town hall in her district of Minneapolis to address the ongoing ICE operations in the city. Hours before, Mr. Trump criticized Ms. Omar at a rally in Iowa and repeated inflammatory remarks about her birth country, Somalia. He said immigrants “have to show that they can love our country. They have to be proud, not like Ilhan Omar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assault occurred just after she said: “We must abolish ICE for good. And D.H.S. Secretary Kristi Noem must resign or face impeachment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her comment mirrored calls by Democratic lawmakers for Ms. Noem, the homeland security secretary, to step down or face impeachment after federal immigration agents shot and killed two people in Minneapolis this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Omar, visibly shaken after the assault, insisted to her staff and security that she would continue. She asked for a napkin and told them: “Just give me 10 minutes. I beg you. Please don’t let them have the show.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Omar then turned the crowd. “Here’s the reality that people like this ugly man don’t understand,” she said. “We are Minnesota strong, and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone in the crowd later thanked Ms. Omar for staying and continuing after the assault, which had shaken not only her but the entire room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I learned at a young age you don’t give in to threats,” Ms. Omar said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About an hour after the town hall, Ms. Omar posted on social media that she was OK and grateful to her constituents for rallying behind her after the assault. “I’m a survivor so this small agitator isn’t going to intimidate me from doing my work,” she said. “I don’t let bullies win.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Capitol Police, which investigates threats against lawmakers, said in a statement that the attack on Ms. Omar was “unacceptable” and would be met with “swift justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are now working with our federal partners to see this man faces the most serious charges possible to deter this kind of violence in our society,” the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As video of the encounter quickly circulated on social media, some officials condemned the assault. Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis denounced the attack, saying on X that “this kind of behavior will not be tolerated in our city,” and that “violence and intimidation have no place in Minneapolis,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican who has often been at odds with Ms. Omar, said she was “deeply disturbed” by the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regardless of how vehemently I disagree with her rhetoric — and I do — no elected official should face physical attacks,” she said in a social media post. “This is not who we are.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27dc-noem-gzwq/27dc-noem-gzwq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his second term, President Trump has been extremely reluctant to fire or even publicly rebuke his aides. So it was no small thing on Monday when he unmistakably gave Kristi Noem, his homeland security secretary, a serious knuckle rapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing an intense and increasingly bipartisan fusillade of criticism over the killing of a protester in Minneapolis and how Ms. Noem and other officials sought to portray the victim as a “domestic terrorist,” Mr. Trump removed the official running the deportation campaign in Minnesota and replaced him with an aide reporting directly to him, effectively cutting Ms. Noem out of the chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked later about Ms. Noem’s characterization of the victim, Alex Pretti, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, declined to defend it, distinctly distancing Mr. Trump from her remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump’s apparent displeasure with the handling of the situation in Minnesota was quickly mirrored in conservative media. A New York Post front page called Ms. Noem “Iced Barbie.” On Fox News, a morning host argued that she should be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her time in Mr. Trump’s penalty box was measured in hours. By Monday night, she was in the Oval Office, meeting with Mr. Trump. By Tuesday the president was telling reporters that her job was safe and that the media should focus more on her role in shutting down illegal immigration into the country, not the chaotic scenes coming out of Minnesota in which agents who report to her have twice shot and killed American citizens protesting their presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think she’s doing a very good job,” Mr. Trump said. “The border is totally secure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the episode was the latest in a year in which her high-profile efforts on behalf of Mr. Trump’s aggressive drive to shut off illegal immigration and deport millions of people have drawn intense criticism and caused heartburn for the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a Republican retiring at the end of his term, told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday that Ms. Noem’s actions had been “amateurish” and that she should be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying,” Mr. Tillis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has frustrated Mr. Trump with some of the department’s tactics, like work-site raids that harmed businesses, including one on a Hyundai factory, according to people familiar with the matter. She has angered Republican senators with her handling of grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. And her propensity for flashy, self-promotional displays has generated some backlash among the rank and file of her agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some members of Immigration and Customs Enforcement disliked what they perceived as Ms. Noem’s theatricality, according to three former agency officials who were granted anonymity to speak frankly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They objected to photo ops that showed her in field gear accompanying agents on immigration operations, accusing her of cosplaying, such as an episode in Phoenix in which her bulletproof vest appeared to be improperly secured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one ICE field office, agents used disparaging nicknames for Ms. Noem that played on her self-promotion, such as “ICE Barbie,” one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some inside the agency believe that leading immigration enforcement is part of a broader effort on her part to run for president in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Ms. Noem’s choice of aides has drawn scrutiny, particularly her reliance on Corey Lewandowski, the onetime Trump political adviser who is a constant presence at her side and was among those in the Oval Office with her on Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside ICE, there have been high levels of distrust of both Mr. Lewandowski and Madison Sheahan, who was installed as deputy director last year. Ms. Sheahan was previously a political aide of Ms. Noem’s. Some officials at ICE believed that Ms. Sheahan was relaying what was happening at the agency to Mr. Lewandowski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond those concerns, there have been more practical issues. Agency officials have been frustrated with being forced to get Ms. Noem’s approval for every contract worth $100,000 or above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ICE, according to one official, that made it more difficult to spend the extra money received from the domestic policy bill signed into law last year by Mr. Trump, especially as the White House presses for huge expansions of detention capacity for the deportation drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official said that even existing contracts had expired as they waited for approval, forcing the agency to pay late fees to companies it contracts with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also frustration at the level of power she gave Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official who had been the public face of the deportation campaign in Minneapolis before being removed by Mr. Trump on Monday. Ms. Noem had installed him to run deportation operations across the country, and, according to three U.S. officials, he reported to Ms. Noem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to remove him from Minnesota, said one official, helps with returning the agency to a more normal chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Noem’s approach to the job has caused bipartisan pushback — both to her tactics on the immigration crackdown and also to her handling of the department’s intelligence analysts — who have been directed to focus more on immigration than other security issues — and the downsizing of FEMA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the raid on a Hyundai facility in Georgia in early September, in which agents detained hundreds of South Korean citizens on hand to help build a new battery plant, Mr. Trump told his top immigration officials to use a more targeted approach when it came to his deportation campaign, according to a senior White House official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump told the officials to “focus on the criminals,” rather than to target work sites like Home Depots, restaurants, hotels and farms. Mr. Trump has told his aides they need to be conscious of the business community when it comes to their mass deportation campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Hyundai raid, people familiar with the episode said, he told a group of senior officials, including Ms. Noem, to “use your heads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Noem’s push to downsize FEMA has also raised alarm among leaders of disaster-prone communities, including Republicans, about the nation’s readiness for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Noem has said cuts to FEMA’s staffing and spending are needed to make the agency less bloated and Washington-centric, and to allow states and communities to lead disaster response, but she has faced blowback for the impacts those changes may have on communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina’s Republican senators repeatedly held up votes on homeland security nominees in the fall until FEMA approved delayed aid for parts of western North Carolina still recovering from Hurricane Helene in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Republican senators were among a group of lawmakers that gathered privately with FEMA veterans this month to raise questions about the ways a FEMA overhaul could affect their constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, said on Monday that he had appealed both to FEMA and to Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, about delays in disaster recovery funds to his home state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Noem’s partisanship has prompted pushback on Capitol Hill from Democrats, more than 160 of whom have signed on to an effort to impeach Ms. Noem. The articles of impeachment, filed by Representative Robin Kelly of Illinois, accuse her of obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust and self-dealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impeachment push will go nowhere while Republicans control the House. But House Democratic leaders said they would keep up the pressure if Mr. Trump refused to fire her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” said Representatives Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Katherine M. Clark of Massachusetts and Pete Aguilar of California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica L. Green, Catie Edmondson, Nicholas Nehamas and Scott Dance contributed reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27nat-minnesota-election-1-hfzj/27nat-minnesota-election-1-hfzj-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats won two vacant seats in the Minnesota House of Representatives on Tuesday, The Associated Press said, restoring that chamber to an even partisan split amid upheaval in the state over the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were not unexpected. The districts are heavily Democratic, and in one of the races, the Democratic nominee was the only candidate on the ballot. Shelley Buck, a former president of the Prairie Island Indian Community’s Tribal Council, won one of the seats, and Meg Luger-Nikolai, a lawyer, won the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seats, one in St. Paul and another in suburban St. Paul, became vacant after the Democrats who previously held them were elected to other offices in November. Assuming there are no other changes before Ms. Buck and Ms. Luger-Nikolai are sworn in, their elections will leave the Minnesota House with 67 Republicans and 67 Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats hold a slim majority in the Minnesota State Senate, and the state’s governor, Tim Walz, is a Democrat. While the results on Tuesday denied Republicans an outright House majority, Democrats will still not be able to enact their policy agenda without Republican support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elections played out at an extraordinarily tense time in Minnesota. Federal immigration agents have flooded into the state in recent weeks, making thousands of arrests, clashing with protesters and fatally shooting two U.S. citizens. Alex Pretti, an intensive-care nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital, was killed by federal agents on Saturday, and Renee Good, a poet and a mother of three, was killed by an agent earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local and state officials have repeatedly criticized the tactics of immigration agents and have filed a lawsuit claiming the surge of federal agents is unconstitutional. The Trump administration has criticized Minnesota Democrats for not cooperating more with immigration enforcement, as well as for a fraud scheme in state social service programs that played out on their watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Minnesota Senate subcommittee is scheduled to hold a hearing on Thursday about the impact of the federal immigration enforcement campaign. State lawmakers from across the country are also expected to visit the state this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several legislative seats in Minnesota have been contested in special elections since the start of 2025 after the resignations and deaths of lawmakers, including State Representative Melissa Hortman, a Democrat who was fatally shot in June in what the authorities called an act of political violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27nat-mountain-lion-ghqf/27nat-mountain-lion-ghqf-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellphones around San Francisco buzzed late Monday night with a very unusual alert: A young mountain lion had been spotted prowling around Pacific Heights, the upscale northern neighborhood dotted with mansions and lush parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you see it, slowly back away,” the alert read, adding that it would also be wise to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents swapped texts and scared-face emojis. Local media outlets posted videos showing the mountain lion walking past Muni bus stops. Another mountain lion had been captured in San Francisco in 2021 after climbing a tree, but any other cougars in town since then had kept a low profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city that famously has more dogs than children, that counts flocks of wild parrots, packs of coyotes and docks filled with sea lions among its residents, went to bed not knowing just how its latest bizarre animal story line would play out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the night, at about 1:30 a.m., Animal Care and Control officers scouring the neighborhood spotted the mountain lion on California Street and called police. Patrol cars pulled up, and officers saw the creature leap over a tall fence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon further inspection, it appeared that the frightened animal had wedged himself in a narrow gap between two apartment buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By early morning, dozens of officials from the San Francisco Zoo, the San Francisco Police Department, the San Francisco Fire Department, San Francisco Animal Care and Control and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife were on the scene — and one of them was inside the apartment of Jessica Fajardo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Fajardo, a 35-year-old tech worker, said it was strange to see an animal control official in her apartment at dawn, but her husband had encountered the officer while out walking the couple’s dog and had invited her up to the sixth-floor apartment for a better look at the mountain lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She came up, she went out onto the fire escape and shone a flashlight around,” Ms. Fajardo recounted in an interview. “I’ve seen a lot of coyotes and have gotten used to cohabitating with them, but definitely a mountain lion is next level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the morning got stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials shut down a section of California Street. Others peered at the puma from nearby rooftops trying to figure out how to get it out of its tiny hiding place. The city sent another cellphone alert that the mountain lion had been located and a nearby school went into lockdown, said Lt. Mariano Elias, a spokesman for the San Francisco Fire Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saga was just the latest in a long string of San Francisco animal happenings. Earlier this month, thousands of people attended the funeral of Claude, the albino alligator who had delighted crowds at the California Academy of Sciences for 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days before that, the city was abuzz about the news that a coyote had swum across the bay to Alcatraz Island, the site of a notorious former federal prison known as the Rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year, Kit Kat, a beloved bodega cat, was struck and killed by a Waymo self-driving taxi, which started the city debating the merits of such vehicles. Just after that, a newly appointed member of the Board of Supervisors had to resign after it was revealed that she had left her pet shop in horrific condition, with animal corpses in the freezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, a record 2,000 sea lions swamped the docks at Pier 39 with a deafening chorus of “Arf! Arf! Arf!” And the San Francisco Zoo has had a string of can-you-believe-it happenings — including a kidnapped lemur in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“San Franciscans do love their animals,” said Cassandra Costello, the San Francisco Zoo’s interim co-chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Animals are a great distraction from everyday life, so a mountain lion walking on city streets is something that really mesmerizes the public,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the mountain lion’s hiding spot, a state official was able to shoot a tranquilizer dart from above to render it motionless. Then a veterinarian from the local zoo shot two more darts from the side and ensured the animal was fully unconscious by prodding it with a pole and getting no response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew was then able to pull the mountain lion into the garden and place it on an orange tarp for a medical exam. It appeared healthy, and an ear tag identified him as a male just under 2 years old who had grown up in a woodsy area about 50 miles south of the city. Young mountain lions often leave their families around that age, but it is not known exactly how or why he ventured all the way to the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As all this was happening, neighbors watched in awe — and with hope that the cat would survive the ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chloe Safier said neighbors had been joking that they should turn the side yard into a petting zoo with a sign reading “Home of the Mountain Lion.” One neighbor, she said, was playing Wordle while watching and had plugged in L-I-O-N-S as her starting word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More than anything, I wanted this little cub to get home to his family,” Ms. Safier said, noting that the capture had made her late to a work meeting, but that her colleagues understood “the mountain lion situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After officials determined the mountain lion was healthy, but fully zonked out and temporarily harmless, they put a mask on him, strapped his legs together and loaded all 77 pounds of him into a metal cage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan, officials said, was to release him back into his native South Bay habitat and hope that when it came to visiting San Francisco, once was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the mountain lion captured, Ms. Safier was ready to relax. She took her baby boy to a nearby park — and there, by the playground, was a coyote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/us/politics/27pol-lewandowski/27pol-lewandowski-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Day 1, he was Donald Trump’s pit bull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corey Lewandowski was a hard-charging political operative who worked for a group backed by the Koch brothers when Mr. Trump put him in charge of a nascent White House campaign with only a handful of staff members in 2015. Untested at the presidential level, he led with a simple mantra: “Let Trump be Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an attack-and-never-apologize style that mirrored his boss’s, Mr. Lewandowski could almost always count on Mr. Trump’s eventual support over the next decade, as he ping-ponged from government to lobbying and back again with several scandals in his wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now back as a top adviser to Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, he finds himself at the center of the uproar over the immigration crackdown in Minnesota, where two American citizens have been killed by federal agents in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lewandowski and Ms. Noem met with Mr. Trump on Monday for nearly two hours as the administration faced intense pressure, including from Republicans, to ease up federal immigration agents’ aggressive tactics in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump did not suggest that either Ms. Noem’s or Mr. Lewandowski’s jobs were at risk, according to people briefed on the meeting, but speculation has swirled about their future amid signs of Republican unease with Ms. Noem’s combative, camera-heavy approach to immigration enforcement. Democrats and a few Republicans have called for investigations into the Minnesota operation that could potentially draw in Mr. Lewandowski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looms as a significant figure inside the Department of Homeland Security, where he has been serving as a “special government employee” despite questions about whether he has exceeded the limit of 130 days a year for such workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Noem’s decision to empower Mr. Lewandowski has frustrated some in the agency and at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of the homeland security department. One D.H.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that Mr. Lewandowski was known as someone willing to fire anyone perceived as getting in his way. At times, this official said, he has mused about which officials were stalling certain priorities and whether they should be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. official said that directions at ICE were coming from Mr. Lewandowski and that nothing got done at the agency without his blessing. At times, this person said, Mr. Lewandowski yelled at ICE leaders as the pressure to meet Mr. Trump’s mass deportation goals increased last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lewandowski has also been present at pivotal moments for Ms. Noem and the department, including speeches and controversial episodes. He was at the news conference in Los Angeles last year when Senator Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, was forcibly removed and handcuffed after he tried to talk to Ms. Noem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lewandowski did not respond to a text message seeking comment. A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment about Mr. Lewandowski, but she pointed to what she called “ICE’s remarkable results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Mr. Lewandowski would again find himself in the center of things was no surprise to Republicans who have watched his cat-with-nine-lives political career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Corey has shown that he is the ultimate loyalist,” said Stephanie Grisham, who worked on Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign and served as White House press secretary during his first term but became an outspoken critic after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. “I’ve never seen him back away or even slightly criticize the president in any way, and that’s pretty much all you have to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in Mr. Trump’s first bid, Mr. Lewandowski attracted criticism that he was not up to the task to make the New York businessman’s bare-bones campaign compete with well-funded opponents like former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. After a narrow loss to Mr. Cruz in Iowa, Mr. Lewandowski faced mounting doubts about the campaign’s strategy in New Hampshire — his home state — but Mr. Trump, of course, ended up sweeping to victory there and then won South Carolina and Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lewandowski further endeared himself to his boss by regularly berating reporters, leaving menacing late-night voice mail messages and threatening to put them in the “doghouse” for critical coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his antipathy toward the news media took a darker turn in March 2016, when he grabbed a reporter for Breitbart News, Michelle Fields, who posted a picture of bruising on her arm. He was charged with battery but the charges were later dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode would be an early preview of how both Mr. Trump and Mr. Lewandowski tended to respond to controversy. At first, they denied the accusations and suggested Ms. Fields was lying, with Mr. Lewandowski calling her “delusional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after video emerged of Mr. Lewandowski grabbing Ms. Fields, the two men continued to dispute what happened. “If you look at her, in my book and according to a lot of people, she’s grabbing at me, and he’s acting as an intermediary and trying to block her from doing that,” Mr. Trump said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he might fire Mr. Lewandowski over the incident, Mr. Trump was blunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t discard people,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Grisham, the former Trump press secretary, said that Mr. Lewandowski “knew to kind of disappear from sight for a while.” She said, “That’s all you really have to do is get out of his line of sight for a while and wait for somebody else to mess up,” adding, “and then you can kind of get back in there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2016, however, Mr. Trump did fire Mr. Lewandowski as campaign manager, with Republicans worried about their presumptive nominee’s weak operation against what seemed like a formidable opponent in Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Lewandowski did not go far, quickly earning a CNN contract and becoming one of Mr. Trump’s chief defenders on cable news. He was paid $20,000 by the Trump campaign in August, two months after he was fired, for “strategy consulting,” according to campaign finance records. In the final weeks of the campaign, he was seen on Mr. Trump’s plane and at his rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Mr. Trump’s victory, Mr. Lewandowski opened a lobbying shop in Washington, where he served as an informal adviser to the president and wrote a book about his time with him titled “Let Trump Be Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also courted new controversies. In December 2017, a pop singer, Joy Villa, accused him of slapping her twice on the buttocks at a party in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, though, he maintained access to the president. The same month, Mr. Lewandowski was in the Oval Office, lashing out at some of Mr. Trump’s top advisers and criticizing the Republican National Committee, all in defense of the president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2021, a Republican donor accused Mr. Lewandowski of making unwanted sexual advances and touching her inappropriately at a dinner in Las Vegas, saying he had grown aggressive and thrown a drink at her when she made clear she was rebuffing him. He was soon removed from his role overseeing a super PAC backing Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump aides insisted at the time that this episode was different, and that Mr. Trump would distance himself from Mr. Lewandowski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But during the 2024 campaign, Mr. Lewandowski was back in the fold, hired as an adviser to the Trump campaign with vague responsibilities. Aides suggested that Mr. Trump found comfort in Mr. Lewandowski’s presence — no matter his history, his volatility or his penchant for controversy — because he was an original believer that Mr. Trump could become president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just like him,” Mr. Trump told Olivia Nuzzi of New York magazine in 2024. “Corey’s a character.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/20lif-ny-state-police-02-fvlj/20lif-ny-state-police-02-fvlj-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigator with the New York State Police helped get a friend’s traffic tickets reduced “in exchange” for her sexually explicit photos, according to a disciplinary letter from 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another stunned a combative suspect with his Taser in 2020 and held down the trigger for 33 seconds, twice the amount of time widely considered dangerous and potentially fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some officers with the agency neglected their duties; others had sex while on duty. Some used their badges to elicit favors; others to settle personal scores. Some failed to call for medical aid when needed; others lied in police reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circumstances of any case of officer misconduct vary. Still, most large police agencies in New York State thoroughly outline steps to be taken in their investigative processes and have explicit disciplinary guidelines that recommend specific punishments — in some cases, even firing — for these types of offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the State Police, New York’s second-biggest law enforcement agency, has no such formal disciplinary guidelines. How a misconduct complaint is investigated, and any resulting discipline, is discretionary. All of these officers remained on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times and New York Focus, a nonprofit newsroom, obtained through records requests thousands of State Police disciplinary files dating back to 1998. For the most part, the files do not include cases of officers committing crimes, which are generally investigated by prosecutors. But they do include confirmed cases of misconduct handled by the agency itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An examination of agency files from 2014 to 2024 revealed a far weaker disciplinary system than those used in other large departments in New York. It is one that has routed complaints of flagrant wrongdoing to low-levels of scrutiny, and that has addressed abuses of power and derelictions of duty with lax punishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some cases were investigated by an internal affairs office, but without formal guidelines, discipline was applied inconsistently. One trooper who had sex while on duty, for example, received an eight-day suspension without pay. Two years earlier he had been caught taking a photo of his genitalia while in uniform. But two others who also had sex while on duty, records show, got suspensions of 45 and 90 days without pay, even though they had relatively cleaner disciplinary records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other cases — those that the office decided could be handled at a lower level — were addressed with a conversation between trooper and supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite repeated calls for reform, the State Police’s disciplinary system remained largely unchanged for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Police declined multiple requests for interviews with agency leadership. Beau Duffy, a director of public information with the State Police, wrote in a statement that “allegations involving serious misconduct are thoroughly investigated” and that the agency began developing a formal disciplinary model in 2025. It is not yet complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The circumstances and facts revealed during an investigation can vary widely” and influence possible discipline, Mr. Duffy wrote, adding that “past precedent, and an employee’s previous history” also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a representative for Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York wrote that “this Administration fully investigates any claims of wrongdoing” and supports Steven G. James, who took over the State Police as superintendent in 2024. The representative declined to comment on actions of past administrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suat Cubukcu, a professor of criminal justice at Towson University who studies discipline in large law enforcement agencies, including those in New York, said that weak disciplinary systems and inconsistencies in punishments could lead to more bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People see that their colleagues aren’t being punished,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 5,200 officers across roughly 200 stations, the State Police has a reputation for investigative work; troopers are often brought in to aid local law enforcement in serious cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But disciplinary files from the agency’s 11 regional troops, many of which had never before been reviewed by journalists, revealed a lack of scrutiny when the department policed its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal affairs office, called the Professional Standards Bureau, independently investigates “serious or complex” allegations of officer misconduct, per the agency’s website, but generally assigns those of a “routine nature” to the commanders of troops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commanders resolve these cases with troopers, who waive their union representation. Following a conversation with the trooper, commanders must write a letter summarizing their findings, and, if they feel it is warranted, issue a suspension not exceeding five days, or a loss of five or fewer vacation days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process was designed so that commanders could handle minor complaints, like lost equipment or cursing on the job. But without formal disciplinary guidelines, the bureau’s determination of which complaints are serious — and which are minor — is subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes the case of the trooper who stunned a suspect and “inadvertently held the trigger” of his Taser for 33 seconds, per a disciplinary letter. The trooper’s commander found his actions were “excessive” and summed up the “informal inquiry” in the one-page letter: “We discussed the importance of attention to detail,” wrote the commander. “Handling a Taser requires your complete attention.” The trooper lost one vacation day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mac Muir, a former investigator for New York City’s Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct by members of the New York Police Department, questioned the State Police’s handling of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Show me a large police department that doesn’t require more than a supervisory review for a 33 second Taser deployment,” said Mr. Muir, who also supervised disciplinary investigations in Oakland, Calif. “I’ve literally never heard of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also criticized the report for lacking an interview transcript, which is not required in troop-level investigations. “Without a recorded statement, there’s no meaningful way to hold the officer accountable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a more robust disciplinary record, the complete context of the case is unclear. But in the New York Police Department, the state’s largest agency, disciplinary policy would suggest that an officer who used excessive force with a stun gun face termination or, at minimum, a 10-day penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about how complaints at the State Police are designated, and who looks into them, are not new. In 1997, a special prosecutor appointed to investigate troopers who tampered with evidence in multiple cases criticized the State Police for resolving complaints of serious misconduct at the troop level, recommending that such cases be investigated by the standards bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel Moran, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law who studies police accountability, called it “troubling” that some cases she viewed as serious were investigated at the troop level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you see such a large agency that doesn’t even have a systematic way of deciding when discipline is appropriate and at what level,” she said, “it suggests a lack of attention to the issue of accountability entirely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, a trooper responding to a “shots-fired” call missed a loaded revolver in a suspect’s pocket, allowing the suspect to bring the weapon into the police station. Ten months later, his commander talked to him and issued a disciplinary letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, another trooper responded “telephonically” to a larceny call at a Lowe’s store, interviewing employees over the phone while he and his sergeant ate breakfast. After conversations with their commander five months later, the trooper lost two vacation days; the sergeant lost three, according to records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate incident two months later, records show, the same sergeant was caught adding false information to a police report. He lost four vacation days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Duffy said he could not comment on previous leadership, adding that the bureau currently does “not assign cases involving serious misconduct to troop level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, the agency faced public scrutiny when the Times Union reported that some high-ranking agency leaders had used their police credentials to access exclusive areas of the Ryder Cup, a golf tournament on Long Island, two months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after the article was published, the agency’s superintendent wrote in a statement that it had learned of the allegations the week prior and was turning the case over to the state inspector general. Many involved in the incident, including the first deputy superintendent in charge of agency discipline, have since resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a representative for the troopers’ union wrote that the scandal exemplified a “two-tiered system, in which rank-and-file Troopers are held to stricter standards than those in leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the weeks following the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, the New York Legislature passed a number of police reform laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the State Police was one of a handful of multicounty agencies excluded from most of the changes, and it unsuccessfully fought in court one of the few that did apply: the repeal of a 1976 law that kept officer disciplinary records secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Police Department made most of its files public in 2021. But despite a court order, the State Police has yet to make its entire body of misconduct files public. WKBW, a Buffalo TV station, reported on some records obtained from a local district attorney about state troopers in their area in 2022. The thousands of State Police files obtained by The Times and New York Focus came through records requests of county district attorneys’ offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They say it’s too burdensome to identify all the files,” said Cory Morris, an attorney on Long Island who in 2021 sued for the disciplinary files of troopers across three counties. He continues to fight the agency for prompt access to the records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then, how much misconduct is there?” he asked in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed an order requiring hundreds of police agencies to submit police reform plans to the state. The Legislature passed a law requiring police agencies to report to the attorney general repeated allegations of misconduct against an officer over a two-year period. Neither requirement applied to the State Police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Taylor, a state assemblyman and author of the bill, said in an interview that he thought the agency faced oversight from the state inspector general’s office. That office investigates waste, fraud and abuse — exploiting overtime, for example — but it does not routinely investigate allegations of law enforcement misconduct, like excessive force. There is no regulation or statute requiring the State Police to report repeated allegations of misconduct to the inspector general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s worth taking a look at it again,” Mr. Taylor said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its most recent reports, from 2020 and 2022, the state inspector general’s office criticized the State Police for its disciplinary practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipline “was extremely lenient and lacked transparency,” the inspector general wrote in a 2020 report about an off-duty officer’s car crash of a federally leased vehicle. The agency lacked policies “to ensure consistency and transparency in the classification of violations,” the inspector general wrote, “as well as the assignment of discipline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the 2022 report, the Professional Standards Bureau began sharing cases it investigates in monthly meetings with the inspector general’s office, according to Mr. Duffy, the agency representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in not yet making the bulk of its misconduct files available to the public, many complaints — and how they were handled — remain concealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some instances, records obtained by The Times and New York Focus show, state troopers evaded public scrutiny — even, in one case, when an officer from another agency faced significant criticism over the same incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021 a police officer in the village of Monticello ended a traffic pursuit by firing his stun gun at a motorcyclist through the passenger-side window. The motorcyclist sustained serious injuries. The officer was suspended, and he resigned in the face of public scrutiny and a disciplinary investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was not widely reported was that a State Police trooper was riding in the passenger seat. The trooper, records revealed, failed to render aid to the motorcyclist, or call an ambulance. He turned off his body camera, and didn’t report the use of force, a disciplinary letter later noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Monticello officer was criminally charged for impeding an investigation and lost his certification to be a police officer in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following an investigation by the standards bureau, the trooper was suspended without pay for three days. He remains on the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26nat-sat-cheating-cfvl/26nat-sat-cheating-cfvl-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, after nearly a century of testing on paper, the College Board rolled out a new digital SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who had long relied on No. 2 pencils to take the exam would instead use their laptops. One advantage, the College Board said, was a reduced chance of cheating, in part because delivering the test online meant the questions would vary for each student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, however, worries are growing that the College Board’s security isn’t fail safe. Fueling the concerns are what appear to be copies of recently administered digital SAT questions that have been posted on the internet — on social media sites as well as websites primarily housed in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT leaks dominated the conversation in November at an international education conference in Seville, Spain, according to Angel B. Peréz, the head of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was the talk of cocktail parties at the international high school conference,” Dr. Peréz said in an interview. “I had a few counselors come up to me to say, ‘we are very concerned.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board was alerted to the cheating efforts by an SAT tutor, according to emails obtained by The New York Times. “This is not a matter of one compromised form. It is a multiyear breach of active test material, accessible on a global scale,” the tutor wrote to the College Board in November, according to the emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutor, who works with students at a prestigious European boarding school, asked the Times not to be identified, fearing harm to his students and school. But after reviewing leaked questions, he said he concluded that at least some of them were authentic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A near-identical version began circulating on the Internet months before it was decommissioned by the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function g is defined by g(z) = |x|a - 14, where a &lt; 0. What is the product of g(15a) and g(7a)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT is administered seven to eight times a year, and the College Board says its network includes 1,700 testing sites in 187 countries. Students take the test at an SAT-approved site, but they are permitted to use their own laptops. While some colleges, including the Ivy League, made standardized admissions tests optional during the pandemic, many top schools have since reinstated a requirement that applicants submit a standardized test score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the sites — bluebook.plus, an apparent knockoff of the official College Board platform, Bluebook, used to administer the actual test — posts what it says are practice tests that students can pay to access. But some of the questions appear to be real, possibly providing questions that ultimately may appear on a student’s actual exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, bluebook.plus, which appears from domain name searches to be based in China, had 875,000 visitors, according to an analysis by the web traffic site Similarweb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bluebook.plus site did not respond to an emailed request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about the security of the digital SAT follow breaches involving other digital tests, including the Law School Admissions Test and Graduate Record Examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board said in written statements that SAT cheating is rare, affecting only a fraction of 1 percent of its test scores, and noted that overall test scores have remained steady after the transition to digital tests. “However, some students will always be tempted to cheat on high-stakes assessment, and bad actors are persistent. We stay hypervigilant,” it wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board also acknowledged that, “in certain international markets, bad actors have long made concerted efforts to access and share test content (as well as fabricate content) in order to take advantage of anxious students and parents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization has taken steps to make cheating on the digital test more difficult. The exam is adaptive, meaning that test-takers who perform well early in the exam receive harder questions as they go along. And the College Board says the tests are drawn from a pool of “several hundred thousand” test items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to having human proctors present during testing, the SAT’s Bluebook platform requires that other apps on a student’s computer be turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the organization acknowledged that it was aware of “screenshots that purport to have been taken while testing is in progress” as well as “hardware and software-based efforts to evade our security system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of coding and SAT “prep” websites discuss ways to bypass Bluebook security. One way is to use a plug-in that seems like a mouse, but is, in fact, a video capture device. Another is a program called a “sandbox, an isolated virtual environment that can work without detection within a computer. Users in various forums, as well as advertisements, also discuss the remote takeover of a student’s computer by an off-site proxy test taker, operating much like an office IT expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test experts caution that many of these ads are scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheating on standardized tests is not new. In the Varsity Blues college admissions scheme, wealthy parents paid test site administrators to allow others to take tests for their children, give them answers or change answers after testing was complete. Other SAT leaks over the years have included the theft of paper tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Franek, editor in chief of Princeton Review, a publishing and test preparation company, said there has been cheating “since these tests were invented,” adding, “certainly, the digital versions were not spared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegations of SAT cheating follow breaches in digital LSAT and GRE tests used by dozens of prestigious law and graduate programs to screen applicants. In those cases, the tests were taken remotely, not in test centers like the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several graduate business schools, including those at the Ohio State University and the University of Minnesota, rescinded admissions offers in 2024 following allegations of GRE cheating by students in Ghana and Nigeria who had taken the tests at home, according to the online publication Poets &amp; Quants, which writes about business schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, the Law School Admission Council, which administers the LSAT, suspended testing in China, the only place that tests were administered remotely. (The SAT is no longer administered in China because of government restrictions in that country. Instead, students travel to Hong Kong, Macau, or South Korea to take the test.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In announcing the LSAT suspension, Susan L. Krinsky, executive vice president of the organization, sounded an alarm about the growth of test cheating. Her organization, she said, had become “increasingly concerned about organized efforts by individuals and companies in mainland China to promote test misconduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added: “This type of activity is not limited to the LSAT; these enterprises purport to offer cheating services for virtually every standardized test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSAT cheating was exposed when a Chinese law student in the United States raised alarms after seeing cheating services advertised on RedNote, a Chinese social media platform. The student, using the pseudonym “Travis,” later discussed LSAT security problems on a podcast hosted by Mike Spivey, an LSAT admissions consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel Schoenig, a former head of security for the ACT, the second-largest undergraduate admissions test, said the web is filled with ads from companies selling hardware and software, purportedly to help students cheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some are scams,” she wrote in an email. But, she added, “The reality is that no system is foolproof.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Schoenig, now chief executive of Cornerstone Strategies, an industry consultant, described efforts to ensure test security and the counter-efforts by cheaters as “always a bit of a cat-and-mouse game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that students are permitted to use their own laptops is one weak link that several experts flagged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that digital test security problems are spreading beyond standardized admissions tests, with companies operating online that offer to take college exams for students, for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornell Law School has notified students that it is investigating a testing breach during a contracts exam in December. The school learned of the problem because a paid test taker — intending to advertise his services — posted screen shots of the exam online shortly after gaining remote access to a student’s laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Cornell confirmed that its law school had investigated an “isolated incident of alleged testing misconduct,” adding that the school would not comment on disciplinary cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the SAT exam is not public, but the tutor who notified the College Board said he was able to authenticate some of the questions students flagged to him. One way was to compare old SAT questions that were retired last year, which the College Board has since published online, with questions posted earlier on cheating sites when those retired questions were still being used on the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, an advanced math question, part of a March 2025 international exam that was posted online and shared with the European tutor by a student, was virtually identical to a question the College Board removed from its question bank in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When presented with the similarities, the College Board said it would not comment on any test content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, metadata showed that questions were posted online almost instantaneously after the test — creating the possibility of “time zone cheating,” in which test takers in a later time zone can gain access to the test questions before their test begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test questions also have been sold on Telegram, a Dubai-based platform, and posted on Scribd, a subscription digital repository of data. Students have also circulated questions among themselves on Google docs, the European tutor said. Many of the tests have been removed from Scribd, apparently at the College Board’s request. A spokesman for Scribd, based in San Francisco, said the company responds to valid requests to remove copyrighted material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the College Board has been unable to fight bluebook.plus, according to an email exchange with the College Board that the tutor shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We did go through the legal process to request a takedown, but as is often the case with international sites, we didn’t get a response,” wrote a College Board security official, Michael Thiel, responding to the tutor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Thiel added: “Some of what’s posted may be real, some isn’t, but none of these sites have all the SAT questions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/28/multimedia/28lif-foil-sidebar-bqhv/28lif-foil-sidebar-bqhv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the past two and a half years requesting and reviewing more than 10,000 misconduct files from New York State’s roughly 500 police agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work has been as tedious as it probably sounds. But it has also contributed to a new era of transparency around policing. These files, many of which had never been reviewed, reveal the systems through which police departments have addressed negligence and misconduct committed by their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work started in 2023, when I filed a request with the Orange County District Attorney’s Office for its “Brady files,” or records about police officers’ potential credibility issues. I assumed I would receive a few files about a handful of officers with known disciplinary histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the office sent me more than 1,600 pages of files pertaining to misconduct by hundreds of officers in the county and the surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to get most of these records is relatively new. Starting in 1976, New York State, by law, kept most police personnel records secret. But when the law was repealed in 2020, many departments began making their records available. Others resisted the change, demanding large payments to do the work of pulling the files, providing lengthy timelines or ignoring requests altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the law’s repeal, the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester filed records requests with every police department in the state. The news organization received huge troves of records, but it also received a number of denials from police departments, a few of which it took to court. From the files it obtained, the organization published an investigation, “Driving Force,” that documented the toll of hundreds of car crashes by on-duty police officers around the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into similar walls. I filed administrative appeals to challenge almost all the denials, citing a growing body of case law requiring the prompt release of these records. In a few instances, I sued to force agencies to comply. (The New York Times, where I worked as a reporter in the Local Investigations Fellowship, a program that helps local reporters produce investigative work about their communities, continues to represent me in a suit against the Erie County Sheriff’s Office.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I stumbled upon a loophole: Though some police departments were denying or delaying reporters’ requests for records, they were required to share files with their county district attorney’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One police chief in Orange County, for example, said in response to my request that there were “no records” of discipline in his department. But records provided by his county district attorney’s office told a different story: An officer in the department had written a confidential letter to members of the village board about accusations of sexual misconduct against the chief, which he denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I filed requests with every county district attorney’s office in the state. Not every office replied, and I would often try again (and again). In counties that did, I used the records from the district attorney to ask for records from local police departments. Many departments released records after they learned that their local district attorney had already provided me with a few. In total, I filed more than 800 requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New York, records requests are governed by the Freedom of Information Law, leading some to refer to these requests as “FOIL requests.” Anyone can file a request with a government agency under this law for access to existing records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other states, New York does not confine records requests to state residents. And though agencies most often receive requests from lawyers or journalists, they are generally barred from considering a requester’s job title or motivation while deciding whether to grant access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agencies can withhold information that falls within specific privacy exemptions, such as the disclosure of confidential informants, law enforcement techniques or material that would pose an invasion of privacy. In most instances, a requester can ask an agency to redact certain information while still turning over some portions of the text, but some agencies are pushing back in court. Almost all of the files I received were redacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote about the contents of the files for New York Focus, a nonprofit newsroom, before joining The Times’s fellowship. I wrote about officers who evaded criminal charges despite driving drunk, an officer who failed to properly investigate a child sexual abuse case and most recently, how the State Police department sometimes handed out lax punishments for officer misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After every article, readers emailed me asking how they could get records for officers in their communities. My process was mind-numbing at times, and I wouldn’t recommend it to everyone. But filing records requests is something the public has a right to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/multimedia/25nat-ice-legislatures-kzjc/25nat-ice-legislatures-kzjc-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the deaths of two American citizens in Minneapolis at the hands of federal agents, Democratic legislators across the country, aided by libertarian groups, are redoubling their efforts to restrict and challenge federal immigration tactics in their states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Colorado bill that was introduced in mid-January would enable individuals to sue federal law enforcement officials for civil rights violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Delaware, a bill similar to one that was filed in New York last spring would prevent commercial airlines from receiving jet fuel tax exemptions if they transport people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement without warrants and due process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the wake of the killing on Saturday of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, a California lawmaker said he would sponsor two bills, one to require that any shooting by ICE agents be subject to an independent state investigation, and another to bar ICE from using state properties as a staging area for federal operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since the second Trump administration embarked on its large-scale deportation effort, Democratic-leaning states have proposed — and passed, in some instances — countermeasures, such as banning masked or unidentified law enforcement officers. Last month, a dozen legislators from seven states announced that they would coordinate legislation in 2026 to complement the litigation already being used by Democratic attorneys general to challenge immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after the killings of both Mr. Pretti and Renee Good, a resident protesting ICE’s presence in the Twin Cities, those endeavors have gained more urgency, according to lawmakers and immigration rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think that we are starting to see legislators who, last session, were afraid of being a thorn in the side of an ascendant Trump administration — they were so afraid of poking the bear,” said Naureen Shah, who leads the American Civil Liberties Union’s immigration and advocacy work. “The tide is now turning, and maybe they feel that they’ve got nothing to lose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, questioned the motives of all those state-level Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Democrats don’t care about the rule of law,” she said. “If they did, they would support the president’s law-and-order agenda, which includes enforcing federal immigration law. Instead, Democrats are openly undermining the rule of law to protect criminal illegal aliens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some states that are controlled by Republicans have gone the opposite direction. A new bill in the South Carolina legislature would mandate that all county sheriffs enter into formal agreements to work with ICE. Tennessee Republicans want government agencies to check the legal status of all residents as a condition of receiving public assistance, and also to verify the immigration status of elementary and secondary school students, despite a decade-old Supreme Court ruling that forbade it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With most state legislatures back in session, patterns are emerging out of the dozens of bills that are active or being discussed, said Gaby Goldstein, the founder of State Futures, which organizes progressive lawmakers nationally and tracks legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are related to rule-of-law concerns and civil rights protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Colorado proposal, for instance, mirrors ones in California, Washington, Wisconsin and elsewhere that seek to establish a private right of action, which would give individuals or organizations the ability to file civil lawsuits for constitutional violations in state court, rather than on the federal courts, said State Senator Mike Weissman, the bill’s primary sponsor and a lawyer by trade. He represents the Denver suburb of Aurora, which Mr. Trump has said has been “taken over” by Venezuelan gangs. His bill would take aim at civil immigration enforcement, he said, “not police officers doing ordinary work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the legislation would apply to ICE and other branches of the Department of Homeland Security, he emphasized that the bill focuses on conduct that would violate constitutional rights rather than on employees of any particular branch of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean, to use a crazy example, if Trump starts mobilizing park service employees to go crack heads and violate the Fourth Amendment, they’re going to find themselves answerable as well,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has been working with the Institute for Justice, a libertarian group that has long battled against federal overreach. One of its cases involves a construction worker in Alabama of Mexican descent who, despite being a U.S. citizen and showing his REAL ID, was detained twice by masked agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under current legal standards, Anya Bidwell, a senior attorney for the Institute for Justice, said individuals find it hard to sue state and local officials, and all but impossible to sue federal ones, who have broader immunity. And with the Supreme Court and Congress showing no appetite to step in, she said it is incumbent upon a state to “protect its own citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Power works in a way that once you have it, you try to accumulate more and more and more of it,” she said. “And it’s really important to be able to fight back and to be able to enforce the rights that are guaranteed to us as individuals. That really shouldn’t be a partisan issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sensibility is also guiding State Senator Anthony Broadman, a first-term Democrat who represents a swing district in Bend, Ore., and is trying to appeal to conservatives who might remember when they were the ones outraged by federal recklessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oregonians, Mr. Broadman said, still remember the armed sieges in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Oregon, he said, “where conservatives have been harmed by the federal government.” So he hopes to introduce a bill similar to the one in Colorado that would apply to federal constitutional violations, but would not be limited to immigration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just liberals and immigrants who get hurt by the United States, when they violate people’s rights,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other targets of state-level Democratic bills include banning agreements that delegate some federal immigration powers to state and municipal law enforcement agencies (Hawaii, Massachusetts, Vermont) and banning masked or unidentified law enforcement officers (Maryland, Arizona, Virginia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bill in Washington would limit the ability of federal immigrant agents to enter child care centers, health care facilities and election sites without a warrant or court order. And in Maryland, one lawmaker wants to prevent ICE agents who were recruited by the Trump administration from later working for any state law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats are also hoping to gain more traction on bills introduced last year that would use fiscal tools to clamp down on immigration tactics, such as by restricting public contracting with companies that work with ICE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers in Maryland and New York have proposed that if the federal government withholds money that the state is owed, in defiance of court decisions, then they would place liens on federally owned properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has already begun to fight back. The Department of Justice sued Illinois in December after the Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, signed a law making it easier for state residents to sue immigration agents. Federal lawyers argued that the law placed the agents in physical harm and at financial risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One state whose legislature is not scheduled to meet until Feb. 17 is Minnesota. But already, legislators are hammering out bills in response to Ms. Good’s death, such as prohibiting or limiting ICE agents from entering sensitive places such as hospitals, schools and group homes, said State Senator Erin Murphy, the chamber’s top Democrat, a nurse by training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another proposal — which she believes has not been introduced elsewhere — would require that federal agents operating in Minnesota meet the same kind of training requirements now in place for local law enforcement — including providing first aid. ICE agents appeared to reject offers to aid Ms. Good after she was shot, including from a man who identified himself as a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no Republican co-sponsors yet for any of the proposed bills. But Ms. Murphy did note that Representative Marion Rarick, who represents a reliably Republican district about 45 minutes northwest of Minneapolis, had posted on Facebook that “ICE must stop racial profiling and violating civil rights as has been experienced and documented by LAW ENFORCEMENT. Full stop. No excuses. Just stop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/00nat-minn-gun-fjzw/00nat-minn-gun-fjzw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images of the immigration crackdowns in Minneapolis and across the United States have been likened to those from the country’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The helmets, camouflage and tactical gear all look straight from the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is that more apparent than in a single photo taken on Jan. 11 by John Locher of The Associated Press. It captures a line of federal agents on the doorstep of a woman’s home, rifles in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon closer inspection, the agents’ equipment tells its own story. Their gear is the physical manifestation of decades of war, fine-tuned and perfected for close-quarters killing over myriad operations in faraway lands but now wielded in broad daylight in American cities. This type of equipment is often reserved for SWAT and hostage rescue units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppressor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppressor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppressors, like the ones on the end of these rifles, have migrated from soldiers to law enforcement officers and civilians. They have proliferated because of the added safety benefits of reducing brain trauma and hearing damage when shooting indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production of firearm suppressors, or silencers, climbed by more than 9,000 percent from 2000 to 2021, according to data from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The suppressor highlighted above is made by HUXWRX Safety Co. In recent years, the company was awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to supply the F.B.I. with its suppressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAWL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAWL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just behind the muzzle toward the front of the rifle are two modular advanced weapons lasers, commonly referred to as MAWLs, made by B.E. Meyers &amp; Co., Inc. The laser is considered top of its class and is described in the company’s literature as “the superior solution for any low light/no light combat environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere, the U.S. military’s dominance on the battlefield was aided by advanced night-vision equipment and thermal-imaging technology. Troops used infrared aiming lasers that evolved from clunky-looking boxes on the end of their rifles to streamlined and ergonomic tools that cost more than $3,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M-LOK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M-LOK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least two of the rifles have modernized black rails mounted around their barrels, which allow accessories to attach more easily. These are Daniel Defense MFR M-LOK rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the M4 — the military equivalent of the AR-15 — U.S. Special Operations Command has championed the M-LOK, or modular lock, for its lighter weight and sturdiness when securing devices like lasers, flashlights and grips. Daniel Defense receivers and barrels are used across the U.S. military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DUMP POUCHES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DUMP POUCHES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also pictured in the photos is a smattering of tactical gear plucked from the battlefield. The tan and camouflage “dump pouches” on the agents’ belts are used to store expended ammunition magazines (though they often just hold snacks and water bottles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAGWELL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAGWELL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clasped on one agent’s weapon is a rifle combat magwell, a piece of plastic that helps widen the aperture for an ammunition magazine so the firearm is easier to reload when adrenaline overpowers fine-motor skills during a firefight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civilian standing in the doorway, at the receiving end of a swarm of well-armed federal agents, was Teyana Gibson Brown. Her husband, Garrison Gibson, who is from Liberia, was arrested during the raid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a video taken from inside the house and posted on Instagram and other social media sites, Ms. Brown yells for the agents to put down their guns. “There’s kids in this house,” Ms. Brown said. “Show the warrant first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge ordered Mr. Gibson’s release four days later, ruling that the agents violated his Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/28/multimedia/28minneapolis-ice-ecuador-consulate-cmlh/28minneapolis-ice-ecuador-consulate-cmlh-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador’s foreign ministry said it lodged a formal diplomatic protest with the United States after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent attempted to enter the country’s consulate in Minneapolis without permission on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees of the consulate stopped the agent from entering, the Ecuadorean foreign ministry said in a statement Tuesday night. Under the Vienna Conventions, to which the United States is a party, foreign consular buildings are off-limits to law enforcement from the host country without authorization from consular officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident comes amid an aggressive federal immigration crackdown in Minnesota that has prompted an outpouring of anger in the state and across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video footage verified by The New York Times shows a member of staff rushing to an entrance to the consulate, where an agent appears to have opened the door. The employee can be heard saying, “This is the Ecuadorean consulate, you’re not allowed to enter.” The agent responds by saying, “If you touch me, I’ll grab you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consulate, in Northeast Minneapolis, has a clearly marked facade emblazoned with Ecuador’s national seal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadorean foreign ministry said it had lodged its complaint with the American Embassy in Ecuador “so that acts of this nature don’t happen again.” The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident comes a week after ICE agents detained 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos outside of his school building in Minneapolis. A photograph of the incident — Liam detained, in a bright blue bunny hat and a Spiderman backpack — sent waves of outrage through the Twin Cities area and across the country. Liam came to America with his father from Ecuador in 2024, and both were pursuing legal asylum claims.&lt;/p&gt;
