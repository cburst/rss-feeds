&lt;p&gt;President Trump has made it unmistakable how he feels about last year’s Nobel Peace Prize going to a Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, and not him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I single-handedly ENDED 8 WARS, and Norway, a NATO Member, foolishly chose not to give me the Noble Peace Prize,” he said on social media last week. Beyond misspelling the award’s name, he also attributed the decision to the entire country of Norway rather than the five-member committee that makes its choices independently of the government in Oslo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Ms. Machado is expected to meet in Washington with Mr. Trump, with whom she has repeatedly sought to curry favor by proposing to share the award with him. She has cheered the U.S. military’s capture of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and remained mum about a bombing campaign against boats Mr. Trump says are smuggling drugs. The American strikes have killed more than 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thorny situation is being greeted with scorn across the Atlantic Ocean in Norway, where the prize is regarded not just as prestigious and freighted with symbolism but also the country’s prime soft-power tool. The Nobel Institute, which awards it, has been in serious damage-control mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, after Ms. Machado floated the idea of sharing the prize with Mr. Trump in a Fox News interview, the institute offered a reminder about what the rules governing the award allow, saying that the facts were “clear and well established.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared or transferred to others,” the institute wrote. “The decision is final and stands for all time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day before Ms. Machado arrived in Washington, Kristian Harpviken, the director of the institute, who is also the secretary of the committee that chooses award recipients, said he would not be drawn further into the deepening controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The prize is awarded on the basis of the laureate’s contributions by the time that the committee’s decision is taken,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That explanation has been insufficient for many Norwegians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A Nobel committee can never guard against peace prize laureates committing acts that run counter to the intention of the prize,’’ Lena Lindgren, a columnist for the Norwegian weekly Morgenbladet, said in an interview. “But what is new now is that the prize is being used in a political game, a warlike game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what Ms. Machado hopes to gain out of her meeting with Mr. Trump. After ousting Mr. Maduro, he declined to install her in power, saying “she’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect” needed to lead the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independently verified vote counts in Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election showed that Ms. Machado’s party had beaten Mr. Maduro by a wide margin. The Venezuelan authorities nonetheless declared Mr. Maduro the victor, and his government embarked on a harsh repression campaign against critics of the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is far from the first time the Nobel committee has been criticized for its choice, or been accused of abetting violent leaders or governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global outrage followed the choice of President Barack Obama, who at the time was presiding over military engagements on several continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And less than a year after receiving the award, Abiy Ahmed, the president of Ethiopia, embarked on a scorched-earth campaign in his country’s Tigray region that left hundreds of thousands dead, wounded and starving. Henry Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ were awarded the prize before a cease-fire to end the Vietnam War broke down, with Mr. Kissinger ultimately trying to return the prize amid a wave of protests. His North Vietnamese counterpart rejected it outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the dispute swirling around Ms. Machado unusual, according to Asle Sveen, a former researcher at the Nobel Institute, is Norwegians’ particularly dim view of Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Machado “has dedicated her Peace Prize to a highly controversial president, to put it mildly,” he said. “It is nearly universally accepted in Norway that Donald Trump attacks liberal democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Norwegian tabloid, Nettavisen, conducted a poll before the announcement of the award that found three-quarters of respondents were against it being bestowed on Mr. Trump, even if he were instrumental in orchestrating a peace agreement in Ukraine or Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Nobel Committee has compromised the prize” by not foreseeing how Ms. Machado and Mr. Trump would use it to justify military intervention in Venezuela, Ms. Lindgren said. “Norway has been politically embarrassed and has failed to manage the symbolic capital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the 2024 election in Venezuela, Ms. Machado went into hiding for more than a year. In December, she secretly left Venezuela to receive her award in Norway. She missed the award ceremony but appeared in Oslo to greet supporters. Her escape was orchestrated by a company run by U.S. veterans with special operations and intelligence training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Ms. Machado did not respond to requests for comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American lawmakers, including Marco Rubio, who was then a Republican senator from Florida and is now Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, had written a letter to the Nobel Committee in 2024 advocating that they award Ms. Machado the peace prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They noted her “peaceful resistance to tyrants” and her “unwavering moral compass,” and said that her efforts showed the “urgent need for international solidarity in the face of aggressive and expansive authoritarianism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is little doubt that Ms. Machado has long risked her safety to challenge an authoritarian government that jails opponents, tortures critics and censors the press. But she has also embraced Mr. Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, repeated debunked claims that Mr. Maduro manipulated U.S. elections and parroted the Trump administration’s claim that Mr. Maduro simultaneously led two drug organizations, despite scant evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her assertions fueled accusations that she was amplifying misinformation in what, until now, seemed a failed attempt to gain the American president’s support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, not all Norwegians agree that the award to Ms. Machado was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If turned out that she supported the U.S. boat strikes, that would not be the best reflection on a laureate, said Marianne Dahl, research director at the Peace Research Institute Oslo. But Ms. Machado was awarded for her pro-democracy work in 2024, Ms. Dahl said. She drew similarities between Ms. Machado and past winners who led popular movements in Nazi Germany, apartheid South Africa and Soviet republics, as well as during the so-called Arab Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is easy to sit in comfortable Norway and criticize her for talking sweet to Trump,” Ms. Dahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, she noted, is exactly what many European and even Norwegian leaders have done. “And they don’t have a repressive regime pursuing them, as Machado has had,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

Director Meets With Venezuela’s Interim President in Caracas</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/16/us/politics/cia-director-ratcliffe-venezuela.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15dc-intel-pflc/15dc-intel-pflc-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C.I.A. director, John Ratcliffe, met with Delcy Rodríguez, the interim president of Venezuela, in Caracas on Thursday, reinforcing the Trump administration’s message that it sees the interim government as the best path to stability in the country in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Ratcliffe is the most senior American official, and first cabinet member, to visit Venezuela since the U.S. military seized President Nicolás Maduro in a raid in the capital nearly two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting came a day after President Trump spoke to Ms. Rodríguez on the phone and on the same day he met with María Corina Machado, the leader of Venezuela’s opposition and a Nobel laureate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-profile visit by Mr. Ratcliffe, and the message of cooperation, could be seen as something of a snub to the opposition, whose supporters have been frustrated that the Trump administration has not tried to put Ms. Machado’s ally Edmundo González into power since Mr. Maduro was seized. Mr. González won the 2024 election, international election experts say, after Ms. Machado was barred from running, but Mr. Maduro refused to give up power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. official said that Mr. Ratcliffe met with Ms. Rodríguez at Mr. Trump’s direction “to deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship.” The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sensitive meeting, added that the two discussed intelligence cooperation, economic stability and the need to ensure that the country was no longer a “safe haven for America’s adversaries, especially narco-traffickers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Trump administration officials, Mr. Ratcliffe’s visit is meant to be an endorsement of the kind of stability that Ms. Rodríguez offers and a sign of trust-building and collaboration between the two governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As early as last summer, senior U.S. officials were discussing how to maintain stability in Venezuela. At the time, the Trump administration was beginning to put together a counterdrug campaign that would involve attacking boats at sea that it said were smuggling drugs and that would eventually lead to Mr. Maduro’s capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As officials planned the campaign of boat strikes, removing Mr. Maduro, either through negotiations or by force, was the president’s goal, officials said. But there was intense talk about how to prevent chaos from spreading around the country after Mr. Maduro was forced out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior officials raised the prospect that breaking up the Venezuelan government after removing Mr. Maduro — even to make way for an opposition leader — would be akin to the mistakes the United States made in Iraq when it dismantled the Iraqi army and created an insurgency, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the discussions last summer, the C.I.A. delivered an early assessment that Ms. Rodríguez, then Venezuela’s vice president, was a pragmatic politician, rather than an ideologue, who would be willing to negotiate and potentially even work with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One intelligence report circulated to senior policymakers mentioned that she wore a $15,000 dress to her inauguration, prompting an official to quip that “she is a socialist but the most capitalistic one I’ve seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Rodríguez had been involved in negotiations with Richard Grenell, Mr. Trump’s special envoy, as well as other officials, as the administration looked for a deal to get Mr. Maduro to voluntarily give up power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No agreement was reached, but people briefed on the discussions said that Ms. Rodríguez proved herself pragmatic, someone who was looking for potential points of agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C.I.A. analysts assessed that having Ms. Rodríguez continue as interim leader was the best way to prevent Venezuela from “descending into some chaotic situation,” a senior official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons learned from Iraq hung heavily over the debates at the top ranks of the Trump administration. Administration officials said that the Bush administration’s decision to push out the entire Iraqi government and dismantle the army ushered in a long era of instability and insurgency that cost Iraqi and American lives and mired the United States in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump and key members of his administration have been critics of the U.S. war in Iraq. But their criticism has focused less on the goal of removing the dictator Saddam Hussein from power and more on the decision to keep troops in the country to provide security for elections and install a democratic government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the operation to remove Mr. Maduro, Mr. Trump has said little about restoring democracy in Venezuela, spending more energy on discussing expanding the role of U.S. companies in the country’s oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also said he wants to see a “transition to democracy” in Venezuela, noting that he worked on the issue for years as a senator. He has long praised Ms. Machado but has noted that the reality is that the opposition is not present in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senior official predicted that when Venezuela held elections, Ms. Machado would have a chance to run. But in the short term, the official said, Ms. Rodríguez is seen as someone who can keep control of the security forces, maintain infrastructure and “cooperate and coordinate with the U.S. government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16int-ukraine-schools-zpwt/16int-ukraine-schools-zpwt-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As millions of Ukrainians endure the winter cold amid blackouts caused by repeated Russian strikes on power plants, Kyiv authorities announced on Friday that schools in the capital would close until February — one of the most severe disruptions yet to daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announcing the closures in a post on social media, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said his top priority was “the safety of children.” Also on Friday, he said that about 70 multistory buildings in Kyiv remained without heat, a week after Russia bombarded heating and electrical infrastructure in and around the capital, while many others, including schools, have operated with limited heat and rolling power outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyiv, home to about three million people, has been among the Ukrainian cities hardest hit by Russia’s attacks this year on energy infrastructure, including power plants, gas storage facilities and electricity substations. The strikes aim to undermine civilians’ morale and pressure the government into concessions in peace talks brokered by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia has targeted Ukraine’s infrastructure in past winters, but Ukrainians managed to cope with the attacks thanks to round-the-clock repairs on the grid and assistance from Western allies. This year, however, Russia intensified its attacks as temperatures in Ukraine plunged well below freezing. Ukraine’s new energy minister, Denys Shmyhal, said this week that not a single power plant had been spared in the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outages in Kyiv, which lasted a few hours in mid-December, can now stretch up to a full day, while heating supplies have dwindled across most buildings. Diesel generators and battery backups, tools Ukrainians relied on in past winters to tide them over during the briefer power cuts, are no longer enough. As a response, authorities have set up tents and public premises where residents can warm themselves, use electricity and get hot drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian authorities have long tried to shield public buildings — schools, local government offices and subway stations — from the blackouts to keep essential services running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on Friday afternoon, Mr. Klitschko hinted at the growing strain, saying, “the situation with the energy supply, which affects the provision of communal services, remains very difficult.” Less than three hours later, he announced the school closures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olena Kozachenko, a 36-year-old mother in Kyiv, welcomed the decision. She said her 7-year-old son, Yaromyr, had been sitting through classes in the cold, with some classrooms barely 12 degrees Celsius, or about 53 degrees Fahrenheit. She sent her son to school wearing thermal underwear, warm winter pants and a sweater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We dress him warmly, extra warm, so that he doesn’t get sick,” she said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Kozachenko added that with the school cafeteria affected by regular outages, students had no hot food. “That means children eat dry cheese sandwiches for breakfast and basically drink cold juice,” she said. “And that’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Kozachenko said her son would be better off at home, where their heating relies not on electricity but on a boiler installed near their building. While her family experiences power outages of 12 to 16 hours a day, she said, they manage with power banks and batteries and have a gas oven to cook meals. “So, for basic daily life, everything is there,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Klitschko said the school closure would be made up with extra classes during spring and summer vacations, when warmer temperatures and longer daylight will make it easier to cope with any remaining blackouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local authorities in Kyiv also announced on Friday that they would restrict outdoor lighting. Streetlights will run at reduced capacity, decorative and architectural lighting will be turned off, and advertising signs will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16int-Syria-Kurds-bwhq/16int-Syria-Kurds-bwhq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Ahmed al-Sharaa of Syria issued a decree on Friday affirming the rights of Kurdish Syrians, according to state media, in what was widely considered an overture to the minority group after days of deadly clashes between government and Kurdish forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presidential decree recognized Kurdish as a national language, alongside Arabic, and adopted Nowruz, the Persian new year that is widely celebrated by Kurds, as an official holiday in Syria. Mr. al-Sharaa also called for the government to grant Syrian citizenship to Kurdish residents who were stripped of it after a 1962 census designed to curb Kurdish political influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement on Friday came after days of intense fighting between Mr. al-Sharaa’s government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., that many feared could escalate into a broader conflict between the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beware of believing the narrative that we want harm to our Kurdish people,” Mr. al-Sharaa said in a video announcing the decree posted on the Syrian Arab News Agency, the state media outlet. “Your well-being is our well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Mr. al-Sharaa’s government and the S.D.F. have been engaged in negotiations to integrate the group into the new national military. But progress on those talks has stalled in recent months, and last week, tensions between the two sides erupted into clashes in the northern city of Aleppo. At least 24 civilians were killed in five days of fighting while thousands were forced to flee their neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was some of the most intense fighting since the end of the civil war in December 2024, when Mr. al-Sharaa’s coalition of rebel groups ousted the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday evening, the prospect of another major clash hung over northern Syria after government troops amassed outside areas in eastern Aleppo held by S.D.F. fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the time Mr. al-Sharaa announced the decree affirming Kurdish Syrians’ rights, the national military said it had begun striking those S.D.F. positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the leader of the S.D.F., Mazloum Abdi, said in a post on X that his forces would withdraw from the contested area and redeploy to regions east of the Euphrates River. It remained unclear whether doing so would head off further clashes with the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fighting over the past week has underscored the challenge Mr. al-Sharaa faces as he vows to unite a country that is deeply fractured after nearly 14 years of civil war. Since his largely Sunni Muslim government came to power, two regions of Syria home to mostly minority groups — the Kurdish-controlled northeast and the Druse in the southern province of Sweida — have refused to submit to the central government’s authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders of both are wary of Mr. al-Sharaa, the former commander of a rebel group once allied to Al Qaeda, and his Islamist-led government. Some also doubt the government’s ability to protect minority rights after bouts of sectarian-driven violence over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kurds, who make up about a tenth of Syria’s population, were denied many basic rights, including identity papers and business licenses, under more than five decades of the Assad family’s rule in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decree Mr. al-Sharaa signed on Friday “breaks decisively” with decades of “Arab nationalist exclusion that denied Kurds” in Syria, according to Ibrahim al-Assil, a senior research fellow at the Middle East Initiative at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, many remained skeptical of the announcement and the motivations behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“⁠Mistrust runs deep, and many Kurds are cautiously welcoming this while remaining skeptical,” Mr. al-Assil said. “Ultimately, the decree will be judged by behavior, not words.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reham Mourshed contributed reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16int-nigeria-makoko-promo/16int-nigeria-makoko-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents of a 19th-century fishing community nicknamed the “Venice of Nigeria” have been left homeless after a government eviction that sent excavators to carry out demolitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders in the community of Makoko in Nigeria and two other nearby settlements in Lagos Lagoon say at least 10,000 people have lost their homes during a demolition process that began in late December and was ongoing Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makoko community leaders and humanitarian groups said at least four people had died during the demolitions. Among them were two infants and a 70-year-old woman who they said suffered respiratory issues after tear gas was fired to scatter families trying to protect their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Lagos State government declined to comment on the reports of deaths and pointed to several news stories citing the government’s position that the demolition was necessary for safety — to move residents away from a nearby power line that could someday fall — and for urban planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State officials and private entities have engaged in numerous efforts in recent years to clear areas in the name of development in Lagos, a sprawling megacity of about 20 million people. Residents say that informal communities in the city are sometimes given little or no warning before being ordered to evacuate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Families settled in the 1800s in Makoko; they live in small shacks on stilts in the lagoon, where they make a living catching and smoking fish that supplies many markets in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largely impoverished area, which residents access by canoe, is on full display for commuters traveling across a busy bridge. Last year, state government officials told Makoko residents that homes could not exist within 30 meters of the power line, which stretches across the lagoon. Later, officials extended the distance to 100 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents met with government officials and agreed to comply. Makoko leaders planted a Nigerian flag in the water at what they said was the 100-meter mark. But as amphibious excavators began work, the machines ripped down homes well past the flag, they said. Nonprofit groups working with residents used aerial photos to estimate that the excavators had torn down homes as far as 500 meters from the power line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a recent morning in Makoko, loud crunching noises from a yellow excavator echoed off the water as homes and fishing shacks were reduced to piles of splintered boards, plastic bowls, crab shells and clothing. Some panicked residents preemptively began destroying their own homes, collecting planks and sheets of tin in narrow wooden canoes, hoping to rebuild elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac Atamado, 15, was threading his canoe through the inky water to get to a pile of broken planks. “This was my house,” he said, looking at what was left of the two-story shack on the lagoon, where he said 12 members of his family had lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ran when he saw the excavator heading for his home Tuesday, and was left barefoot, with only the shirt and pants he was wearing after it was demolished. He has been sleeping on the wet, dirty floor of his narrow canoe with his brother. He said he was unsure where his family will live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francis Samson Vituwa, a Makoko community leader, said thousands of residents were in similar situations. Mr. Vituwa can trace his roots to his grandfather who settled in Makoko. “It’s a good life here,” he said. Living in Makoko has allowed him to support his wife and send his five children to school, he said. “There’s no good coming from this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several residents staged protests this week at the State House of Assembly in Lagos, where officials pledged on two separate days to pause the demolitions, said Megan Chapman, co-director of Justice &amp; Empowerment Initiatives, one of the community groups supporting residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But excavators have kept at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is still a community to save,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16dc-trump-nobel-bzch/16dc-trump-nobel-bzch-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since President Trump first took office in 2017, he has been obsessed with the Nobel Peace Prize, and has made no effort to hide his deep sense of injustice that President Barack Obama won it in 2009 for, in the eyes of the Nobel committee, his “extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has a different view, which he offered in an interview with The New York Times last week: Mr. Obama “was there for a few weeks, and he got it. He didn’t even know why he got it.” Mr. Trump then recited the now-familiar list of “eight wars” he claims to have stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this culminated on Thursday afternoon in a bizarre scene in a White House that has had its share of jaw-dropping events. The president took possession of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, which its true recipient, María Corina Machado, had turned over, framed in gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a window into the president’s psyche, including his deep need for affirmation of his role as a “peacemaker,” even after a year of ordering military strikes on several continents. It was also revealing of Ms. Machado’s political calculations. Her party overwhelmingly won the 2024 presidential election in Venezuela but has been barred by Mr. Trump from any role in governing the nation after the capture of Nicolás Maduro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump said he was “honored” to finally receive the prize, and he grinned broadly as he posed with Ms. Machado in the Oval Office, holding the oversized frame. Shortly after, Ms. Machado left. The medal stayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maria presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done,” Mr. Trump later effused on social media. “Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you Maria!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, it was a pretty hollow event for both of them. Mr. Trump can hang the medal on the wall, but to the rest of the world — and in the records of the Nobel committee — he cannot legitimately call himself a Nobel laureate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was made clear a few hours later by Kristian Berg Harpviken, the director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, who archly noted that “receiving the symbols of the Peace Prize does not make anyone a Peace Prize laureate.” This has been tried before, he noted, including once in 1943 when Knut Hamsun, who won the Nobel literature prize in 1920, sent it to the Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. (Mr. Hamsun, who often espoused admiration for Hitler, mailed the medallion to Goebbels. But it was lost after Goebbels committed suicide in 1945.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gifting plan also did not seem to work for Ms. Machado, at least immediately. As she and Mr. Trump were meeting, the C.I.A. director, John Ratcliffe, was in Caracas meeting with Delcy Rodríguez, the interim president of Venezuela. She had been Mr. Maduro’s vice president, and was part of the forces that barred Ms. Machado from running in the election — one of many steps the Maduro government took to fix the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Mr. Trump has chosen to operate Venezuela through the very people Ms. Machado fought. The prize — the one Mr. Trump claimed as his own — was essentially given to mark the bravery of those who stood up to the forces Mr. Trump has now embraced, betting that Ms. Rodríguez will do his bidding and grant U.S. companies access to the world’s largest oil reserve. And Mr. Trump believes the old regime — not Ms. Machado — is most likely to enable the United States to run Venezuela’s affairs by remote control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, in short, realpolitik in its rawest form, something Henry A. Kissinger would have admired. If that means embracing the political power structure set up by Hugo Chávez and Mr. Maduro — and rejected by a strong majority of Venezuelans — that is the price that Mr. Trump appears willing to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed like Ms. Machado had been cornered into making her gift. At first, she had “dedicated” the Nobel to Mr. Trump. But in an interview last week, Sean Hannity, the Fox News commentator and one of Mr. Trump’s supporters and informal advisers, asked the opposition leader, “Did you at any point offer to give him the Nobel Peace Prize?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Machado said that “it hasn’t happened yet, but I certainly would love to be able to personally tell him” that he, and the Venezuelan people, shared in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That changed, and now Ms. Machado appears to be playing the long game. She is betting that sooner or later, the survivors of the Maduro regime will be ousted, and so giving Mr. Trump what he wants — that golden Nobel medallion — is a worthwhile investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have no doubt that President Trump, his administration and the people of the United States support democracy, justice, freedom and the mandate of the people of Venezuela,” she said on Friday in a speech to the Heritage Foundation, ticking off four values that Mr. Trump has spoken about very little as he has described his plans to bring American enterprises, especially oil companies, back to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She insisted that “once the regime is out and the transition is accomplished, the United States will not only be a safer nation, but one that will have more prosperity and strength in our hemisphere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger mystery is how Mr. Trump regards the handover of the prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He clearly was interested in possessing it, perhaps because possession, as he has said of Greenland, is “psychologically important.” Of course, he already has one Nobel Peace Prize medallion just steps from the Oval Office: the 1906 award given to Theodore Roosevelt, which is kept in the Roosevelt Room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roosevelt won the prize for bringing an end to the Russo-Japanese War, and even some of Mr. Trump’s critics have said that, if Mr. Trump could do the same for the war between Russia and Ukraine, he would be the natural candidate for the next award. But that has been frustratingly elusive, as Mr. Trump himself often admits, even while ticking off other conflicts — India vs. Pakistan, Thailand vs. Cambodia, Israel vs. Hamas and Egypt vs. Ethiopia, among others — that he claims credit for ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Friday that Mr. Trump intended to keep the prize, but noted that “its final home in the White House is still yet to be decided.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she suggested that the issue was not over for Mr. Trump, that the wrong he believes was committed against him by the Nobel committee has not been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It does not solve the problem,” she said, “and he’s still worthy of actually being the recipient of the reward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16Barkay--01-vwgz/16Barkay--01-vwgz-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Barkay, a leading figure in biblical archaeology whose many discoveries in and around Jerusalem, including a pair of silver amulets from the seventh century B.C. that contained a priestly inscription, changed how historians understood early Jewish life, died on Sunday in Jerusalem. He was 81.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His daughter, Naama Barkay, said his death, in a care facility, was from complications of an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Barkay, whose name was sometimes written Barkai, spent more than 50 years leading some of the most important digs into the ancient history of central Israel, a record that earned him a reputation as the “dean” of biblical archaeologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zachi Dvira, an archaeologist and former student of his, wrote in a biographical essay for Dr. Barkay’s 80th birthday that he “believes that archaeology serves as a vital link between the past and the present, and he embodies this principle through his actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Barkay was especially interested in how the region’s earliest residents treated the dead. During the late 1970s, he examined a network of burial caves carved into the hills southwest of Jerusalem, where he found a pair of amulets containing scrolls from the mid-600s B.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took years to figure out how to unravel the scrolls without ruining their script, but when they were finally opened and the Paleo-Hebrew text was translated, in 1986, Dr. Barkay found that they contained a priestly benediction from the Old Testament book of Numbers. It was the oldest instance of writing from the Bible — and evidence, he argued, that the writing of the Old Testament began several centuries earlier than many historians had thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to the history of Jerusalem itself, Dr. Barkay considered himself a “maximalist” in the debate over the ancient city’s size and importance. He used the placement of burial sites, which had to be set a specific distance outside the city walls, to show that it was much larger than the so-called minimalists had argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Barkay was very much a public-facing archaeologist, offering his expert opinion in TV series like “The Naked Archaeologist” and documentaries like “The Real Da Vinci Code.” He gave frequent public lectures and offered training for tour guides around the Old City of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also something of an activist: In 2000, after the Israeli government refused to stop a Muslim organization, the Waqf, from digging out space for a subterranean mosque on the holy site in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount, he and several other archaeologists formed the Committee for the Prevention of the Destruction of Antiquities on the Temple Mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How The Times decides who gets an obituary. There is no formula, scoring system or checklist in determining the news value of a life. We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did not oppose the mosque, they said, but rather the lack of archaeologists’ involvement in a project involving the removal of thousands of tons of earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, he and others founded the Temple Mount Sifting Project, a crowdsourced program to examine the estimated 400 truckloads of dirt taken from the site. Since then, volunteers have identified about a half-million artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was sometimes criticized as a tool of right-wing Israeli governments eager to establish historical claim to the Temple Mount, which is a holy site for Jews, Muslims and Christians but is primarily controlled by the Waqf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Barkay insisted that his interest was purely intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sneezing in Jerusalem is an intensive political activity,” he told The Times of Israel in 2019. “You could turn your head to the right, or the left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Breslauer was born in Budapest on June 20, 1944, soon after Nazi Germany occupied the city. He and his mother, Rosa (Legaty) Breslauer, were forced into the newly created ghetto and barely escaped a death march to Vienna, saved only by the liberation of Budapest by Soviet troops in January 1945.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I owe my life to the Russian army, to nobody else than Joseph Stalin,” he said in a 2023 interview. “Many others owe him their death; I owe him my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His father, Eliezer Breslauer, had already been sent to a camp in Ukraine, though he survived and later rejoined the family. Mr. Breslauer later worked for the Jewish Agency, which facilitated emigration to Israel. Gabriel and his parents emigrated themselves in 1950, settling in Jerusalem, and they changed their surname to Barkay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, he was taken with the empty, arid stretches of land outside the city that, he knew, bore the imprint of millenniums of human habitation. By 10, he was conducting his own digs, and a few years later, he joined the Israel Exploration Society, an amateur archaeological club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He received his bachelor’s degree in archaeology and geography from Hebrew University in 1967 and his doctorate in archaeology from Tel Aviv University in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then, he was already a veteran archaeologist, with a series of digs in Israel, Egypt and Iran to his name. He was a popular lecturer as well, first at Tel Aviv University and later at Bar-Ilan University and Jerusalem University College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Barkay’s first marriage ended in divorce. Along with his daughter, from his first marriage, he is survived by a son from that marriage, Elad; his partner, Esther Yerushalem; and six grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Barkay insisted that archaeology was not just about the past, but was also a tool for examining the way history reaches up into the present through the materials people left behind. And he remained in thrall with Jerusalem, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my 56th year in Jerusalem,” he said in a 2006 lecture at Bar-Ilan. “I know the city. But every day, I discover there is more and more to be known about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16greece-migration-zjgq/16greece-migration-zjgq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 24 aid workers who had been put on trial in Greece after rescuing migrants at sea was acquitted of all charges on Thursday, according to lawyers who attended the hearing, in a case that had been widely condemned by rights groups as an attempt to criminalize rescue work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former volunteers, who included the Syrian refugee turned campaigner Sara Mardini, had faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted on charges including facilitating illegal entry, money-laundering and membership of a criminal organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their prosecution was the latest salvo against both aid workers and migrants across Europe as leaders in Greece and beyond aimed to prevent a repeat of the 2015-2016 crisis that saw hundreds of thousands of people flee war and poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island of Lesbos, where the trial took place, was the front line of that crisis — and a focal point for volunteers who scrambled from across the world to rescue migrants at sea and help them after they landed. The volunteers included Ms. Mardini and her 23 co-defendants, who worked with the now-defunct Greek nonprofit Emergency Response Center International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A criminal court in Lesbos cleared the defendants at a hearing on Thursday, saying their aim was not to commit criminal acts but to provide humanitarian aid, according to Zacharias Kesses and Evita Papakiriakidou, defense lawyers present in court. Court officials declined to comment by phone on the verdict because the judges have yet to formally issue it in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kesses, who represented several defendants including Ms. Mardini, said the decision was a “courageous ruling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The decision is of particular importance because it prevented the creation of a dangerous precedent that would have threatened the humanitarian and solidarity movement,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict came amid growing restrictions placed on migrants and their advocates by Greece’s conservative government. Recent legislation means that asylum seekers now face up to five years in prison if they remain in the country after their applications are rejected, and civil society groups face greater limits on their work with refugees. Those moves followed a broader crackdown on migrants trying to reach Greece, with a New York Times investigation in 2023 finding that Greek Coast Guard officers had rounded up asylum seekers and abandoned them at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aid workers’ exoneration was the culmination of a judicial process that began in 2018 with the arrest and detention of several volunteers, including Ms. Mardini, who is the sister of the Olympic swimmer Yusra Mardini. The sisters drew global attention in 2015 after they escaped the war in Syria and helped to pull their sinking boat — and another 18 refugees — to safety on the shores of Lesbos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Greek court threw out previous misdemeanor charges against the activists, including espionage, in early 2023. Their subsequent trial on more serious criminal charges, which began in December, took nearly three more years to get to court, keeping the defendants in legal limbo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rights groups welcomed the decision to dismiss those charges but also said it was a reminder that tougher migration policies have virtually stamped out humanitarian work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Justice for these 24 individuals is a relief, but the environment for solidarity in Greece remains under siege,” said Eva Cossé, a senior researcher stationed in Athens for Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights group. “The Greek government’s campaign of criminalization has already achieved its chilling effect, shutting down independent rescue work in the Aegean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict, which the lawyers said was final and could not be appealed, appeared to draw little reaction from right-wing groups that had previously been vocal critics of rescue workers. Public interest in the case has diminished, partly because migration levels have dropped significantly since their 2015 peak. In general, Greek court verdicts rarely provoke significant public pushback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16int-skorea-yoon-lbvj/16int-skorea-yoon-lbvj-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s impeached and ousted former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, was sentenced to ​five years in prison on Friday for fabricating an official document used to briefly impose martial law in 2024 as well as illegally using his bodyguards to ​prevent his arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentence on Friday from a three-judge panel at the Seoul Central District Court was the first in ​eight separate court trials stemming from his ill-fated martial law declaration. The ruling on the most consequential charge — insurrection — is scheduled to be delivered by a different panel of judges on Feb. 19. Prosecutors ​in that case have sought the death penalty for Mr. Yoon​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their ruling on Friday, the judges convicted Mr. Yoon of obstructing justice when he ordered his presidential secret service agents to block law enforcement officials from serving a court-issued warrant to detain him on insurrection charges last January. The officials eventually detained him ​several days later on their second attempt to serve the warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He turned ​his Presidential Security Service​, trained to be loyal to the country, into a de facto private army for his personal safety and interests,” the presiding judge, Baek Dae-hyun, said in the ruling on Friday, which was nationally televised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Yoon was also convicted of abusing his power when he failed to invite some of his cabinet members to a cabinet meeting on the night of Dec. 3, 2024, denying them their right to review his plan for martial law before​ he declared it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Dissident’s Next Act: Kwon Pyong recounted for the first time the series of gambles that got him out of China by jet ski, and almost a year later, out of South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standoff With Doctors: Doctors at medical facilities across South Korea walked off the job in a one-day strike on June 18, expanding a months-old protest against the government’s health care policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Impeachment Threat: President Yoon Suk Yeol has been accused of intervening in an inquiry into the accidental death of a South Korean marine during a peacetime search and rescue operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliament Election: South Koreans delivered a stinging defeat to Yoon and his party, giving the opposition one of its biggest electoral victories in recent decades and pushing Yoon to the verge of being a lame duck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Yoon’s original martial law decree was not endorsed with signatures from his cabinet members. On Friday, he was convicted of fabricating a document to make it look as if ​his martial law plan had been reviewed and endorsed by cabinet members. He was also found guilty of ordering the removal of data from government-issued secure phones of his collaborators in martial law, ​such as military generals, in order to obstruct investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M​r. Yoon’s acts amounted to an abuse of his presidential power and a “grave crime,” Judge Baek said​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M​r. Yoon, who appeared at the courtroom on Friday, exited after the ruling without comment. He and his lawyers have a week to appeal the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​Mr. Yoon was unpopular throughout his two and a half years in office​. He governed a deeply polarized country, constantly clashing with the majority opposition over ​his policies and scandals involving his wife. The tensions culminated when he declared martial law on Dec. 3, 2024. He banned all political activities and sent troops to take over the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which he called a “monster” and “den of criminals” that he said “paralyzed” his administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his martial law decree lasted only six hours. The legislature voted it down while citizens held back troops to prevent them from raiding its main voting hall. ​When the Assembly impeached him, suspending him from office, Mr. Yoon holed up in his hillside presidential residence in central Seoul​, vowing to “fight to the end​.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​He repeatedly ignored summons from investigators to face questioning for insurrection charges.​ When they sought to detain him last January, he refused to surrender. His ​bodyguards built barricades of buses and formed human chains to repel investigators and police officers, raising fears of a clash.​ Mr. Yoon insisted that the officials had no right to detain him because he said his call for martial law had been legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only when the investigators visited the compound again several days later in overwhelming numbers could they​ serve the warrant and detain ​him. Mr. Yoon was the first sitting president of South Korea to be arrested in a criminal investigation. He was later formally removed from office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Yoon’s martial law, although short-lived, threatened decades of hard-won democracy in South Korea and exposed deep fractures in its politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, South Korea elected a new president, Lee Jae Myung, one of the political leaders whom prosecutors said Mr. Yoon had planned to arrest under his martial law. Small groups of die-hard supporters of the ousted leader still hold rallies in Seoul, calling his impeachment invalid and chanting, in English, “Yoon again!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his jail cell and through his lawyers, Mr. Yoon continues to argue that he declared martial law to “wake” citizens up to the danger posed by “anti-state forces” among the political left. He has called special prosecutors who indicted him “a pack of wolves” controlled by “dark forces.” His old People Power Party remains mired in internal fighting between those who call for disowning him and those who remain sympathetic toward him. The party planned to change its name to make a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro, a stalwart leftist, has promised to achieve peace settlements with armed groups that have kept the country in a near-constant state of conflict for more than half a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now Mr. Petro is threatening military action, alongside Venezuela, against the largest of those groups, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, a one-time revolutionary guerrilla group that experts say has become a major cocaine trafficker with a deep foothold in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the ELN does not join the peace process by leaving Venezuela, there will be joint military actions with Venezuela,” Mr. Petro wrote on X on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela’s interim government did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Petro’s message. But his warning reflects the pressure facing Latin American leaders as President Trump demands that the region’s countries — from Colombia to Mexico — target groups the United States has designated as terrorist organizations, or risk unilateral U.S. action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fear that Mr. Trump is serious grew significantly this month after the United States raided Venezuela and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro, citing as a justification his federal indictment on charges of narco-terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has declared that the United States is in an armed conflict with a confidential list of 24 drug cartels and criminal groups it has designated as terrorists. (There is no evidence that the groups are engaged in such a conflict.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ELN is on that list, which The New York Time obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ELN’s top commander, Eliécer Herlinto Chamorro Acosta — who uses the nom de guerre Antonio García — in response to questions from The Times, asserted that U.S. prosecutors “will not find evidence because there is none — it does not exist. We are not and will not be drug traffickers.” He also denied the group was present in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ELN formed in Colombia as a Catholic-Marxist group in the 1960s. But experts say that by the 1990s it had turned to cocaine trafficking, like the more powerful Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Colombia’s U.S.-backed military descended on the groups and the FARC splintered. Experts say the ELN took refuge in Venezuela, and expanded there, growing wealthier through drug trafficking, tripling in size to around 6,000 fighters, and forging links with corrupt Venezuelan officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombian authorities have said that the armed group served as a useful shield for the Maduro government against domestic and foreign threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the U.S. military buildup began in the Caribbean, Venezuelan officials relied on the ELN to protect the border with Colombia, which they worried could be a back door for U.S. military operations, and the ELN vowed to respond to any American intervention, said Elizabeth Dickinson, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, a research institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The message from Caracas over these recent months has been you lock down the border, that’s your job,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Mr. Maduro gone and Venezuela’s interim government leaning toward rapprochement with Washington, the future of that alliance is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. García, of the ELN, acknowledged contact with the Maduro government, but said it was in the context of its peace negotiations with Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia and Venezuela’s escalating crackdown on drug traffickers appears focused on Catatumbo, a mountainous border region that the ELN has fought to control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela’s interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, in a news conference this week touted recent anti-narcotics operations, including in the Venezuelan side of Catatumbo. He called them a “serious blow” to the cocaine industry and the “narrative that Venezuela is a country that facilitates the traffic of drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not name the ELN. Asked by a reporter which “cartels” were involved, Mr. Cabello deflected. “Depends,” he said, adding, “What we do know is that they come from Colombia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cabello’s assertions came as the he stands accused, in the federal indictment against Mr. Maduro, of being “enriched” by drug profits and of partnering with the ELN and other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after Mr. Maduro’s capture, President Trump accused Mr. Petro of also being involved in the drug trade and suggested military action against Colombia was possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hastily arranged phone call between the two presidents eased tensions but only increased the pressure on Mr. Petro, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent days, the Colombian president repeatedly trotted out data on his government’s drug seizures and its success in curbing the cultivation of coca, the base product for cocaine, which nonetheless remains at record levels amid soaring global demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also turned his sights on the ELN. Peace talks between the government and the group were suspended last year after particularly deadly clashes in Catatumbo left 80 dead and more than 50,000 displaced, an episode Mr. Petro called a “massacre.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the ELN proposed a nationwide “agreement” with the government, an offer Mr. Petro rebuffed. “An agreement was offered, and the ELN destroyed it with blood and fire,” he wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called instead for ELN fighters in Venezuela to disarm, return to Colombia, and begin a process to cede territory and reintegrate into society — or face military action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The order I gave was a total offensive against the ELN in Catatumbo,” Mr. Petro said in an interview with The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Mr. Maduro’s capture, Mr. Petro also announced the deployment of 30,000 troops to his country’s 1,300-mile border with Venezuela. “The first order I gave was not to defend Venezuela or anything like that,” he said, alluding to claims he was in league with Mr. Maduro. Instead, Mr. Petro said, he ordered ELN fighters to “disarm and re-enter Colombia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say Mr. Petro’s resolve to either dismantle or crush the ELN is a reflection both of Mr. Trump’s demands, and of domestic frustration over his past handling of armed groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Petro, Colombia’s first leftist president, entered office in 2022 criticizing its military-focused strategy against the groups as ineffective. He promised “total peace” with the groups, some of which still claim to be left-wing revolutionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During talks, the military paused offensive operations, but analysts and government officials say groups like the ELN took advantage to expand their territory in Colombia, plant more coca crops and consolidate trafficking routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Dickinson, the analyst for the crisis group, said the failure of the government’s peace policy came as a disappointment to Mr. Petro and his government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They really believed that they could sit these armed groups down and make a deal because of who they were,’’ she said, “because they’re left and because they know them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of any breakthrough shifted Mr. Petro toward “a hardhanded approach,” Ms. Dickinson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Petro’s original approach also eroded trust with Colombia’s security forces. A patchwork of cease-fires left them without any clear rules of engagement with armed groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s difficult for police and soldiers to know exactly how they’re supposed to be combating those groups,” said Geoff Ramsey, who studies Colombia and Venezuela at the Atlantic Council, a Washington research institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia has one of the region’s largest militaries, with about 269,000 active personnel — second only to Brazil in South America. Yet analysts say much of its equipment is aging and costly to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Petro, in the interview with The Times, also expressed concern over the military’s lack of newer technology including drones, even as the ELN has become a technologically capable and organized force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ELN commander, Mr. García, said his organization’s “engineers and technicians” had built drones and anti-drone systems over the past decade. Analysts say the group is, in fact, known to have such armaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has suggested that United States wants to carry out land strikes against designated cartels and the administration is pressing Mexico to allow U.S. military forces to conduct joint operations against fentanyl labs in that country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if the United States has similar plans for Colombia or Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Dickinson said any strikes against the ELN could cause civilian casualties and do little to dismantle the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ELN is not like a conventional force, it’s not like they’re parked in the forest and you can just bombard them,” she said. “They work in plain clothes, they operate within cities and towns. You can’t blow up the ELN. It doesn’t work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada will lower tariffs on some Chinese electric vehicles and China will do the same for Canadian canola products, a major shift in policy that was announced on Friday during a landmark state visit by Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Carney announced that Canada will allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market under a preferential tariff rate of 6.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, at the behest of the Biden administration, Canada imposed a 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the new tariff changes are modest, they signal an important break with the United States as Canada seeks to urgently diversify its trading partners and reduce its reliance on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Donald J. Trump has imposed on tariffs on some key Canadian exports like lumber, steel and autos. He has also threatened Canadian sovereignty, a shift Mr. Carney has described as a “rupture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Carney also announced on Friday that China would make a “considerable investment into Canada’s auto-sector” within the next three years as part of the agreement to lower tariffs on electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange, Mr. Carney said that China will lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed to a combined rate of approximately 15 percent, down from about 85 percent, offering fast relief to a major Canadian agricultural sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement came just after Mr. Carney met with President Xi Jinping of China in Beijing Friday, during a three-day state visit that both leaders hailed as a significant reboot in their nations’ previously frosty relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Xi and I are announcing that Canada and China are forging a new strategic partnership,” Mr. Carney said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16int-iran-protests-lbpq/16int-iran-protests-lbpq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A heavy police presence and deadly crackdowns on protesters appeared to have largely suppressed demonstrations in many cities and towns across Iran, according to several witnesses and a human rights group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For weeks, Iran has been convulsed by protests sparked by a collapsing economy and a currency in free fall, with the demonstrations snowballing into a broader antigovernment movement. The authorities have sought to quell the protests with brutal force and have plunged the country into a communications blackout that has made it difficult to know what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four residents reached by The New York Times in the capital, Tehran, said that the streets had mostly been quiet of protests this week as the severity of the crackdown and the high number of casualties became clear. Security forces were deployed in large numbers to nearly every neighborhood, said the residents, who lived in different parts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. They said that it felt as if the capital was under martial law, with the typically bustling and traffic-clogged streets largely empty. Shops and restaurants in some areas were closed after 6 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is massive disappointment and disillusionment,” said another resident, who worked in central Tehran and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been no large-scale protests documented in Iran since Sunday, according to Arina Moradi and Mina Khani, members of the Norway-based Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, which has been monitoring the demonstrations since they began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Moradi said in an interview that a heavy military and security presence remained across many cities and towns, with thousands of people having been detained. She said numerous universities had closed following protests last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Israeli defense assessment found that the scale of protests had noticeably declined since Sunday, following the Iranian forces’ escalating use of live ammunition and the internet blackout, according to two Israeli officials who spoke to the Times on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the numbers continued to drop, they said, several Israeli intelligence officials monitoring Iran had concluded that the current wave of protests had effectively been subdued by the regime. The two officials noted, however, that the Israeli assessment had been complicated by the disruption of internet and telephone services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions across Iran and the region have been high after Mr. Trump recently declared he was prepared to intervene to protect protesters, including potential military strikes against the country, U.S. officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel and several Arab nations have urged President Trump not to strike Iran, a senior U.S. official said. Many Gulf States worry that an attack could destabilize the region and jeopardize their reputations as safe hubs for business and tourism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin said on Friday that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia offered to mediate so as to ensure regional stability after speaking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The situation in the region is extremely tense,” a Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters on Friday, adding that Mr. Putin was trying to facilitate a de-escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent days, the Iranian authorities have stepped back from threats to execute protesters, following international condemnation and the looming possibility of U.S. military action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But regional analysts note that Tehran is drawing a line between ordinary demonstrators and those it labels “rioters” or “terrorists” purportedly backed by foreign powers. Experts say this careful framing is intended to intimidate the population and discourage further protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has been instilling fear into protesters by sending text messages warning families not to let their children go out into the streets. Other messages have urged people to report suspicious activities or encouraged them to attend pro-government rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a screenshot shared by a resident with The New York Times, a text message asserting to be from the intelligence branch of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said it had received more than 400,000 calls to a hotline for reporting “terrorist networks,” and that they had been “identified and dismantled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s violent crackdown has had an especially chilling effect on the protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnesses said security forces had fired on unarmed demonstrators at close range. More than 2,600 people have been killed since protests began, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights group said that more than 3,400 people had been killed and thousands of others injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Mr. Trump said the United States was “locked and loaded” to protect Iranian protesters, whom he later urged to take over government institutions, saying U.S. support was imminent. Since then, Mr. Trump has announced that diplomatic talks with Iran were on, then off, and most recently said Iran had responded to his demands by halting the killing and execution of protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday that President Trump and his team were “closely monitoring the situation” and that “all options remain on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
