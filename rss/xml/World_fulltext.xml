&lt;p&gt;Dan Goodwin’s left shoulder felt like it was on fire and his right hand was covered in blisters by the time he finished climbing one side of Toronto’s CN Tower in 1986. Back then, it was the tallest structure in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was terrified,” he said, recalling the day he reached the base of the tower’s observation deck, 1,100 feet above a crowd of onlookers and with no rope, harness or other safety equipment. “Every move had to be perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Alex Honnold, a rock climber who was the subject of the Oscar-winning documentary “Free Solo,” will attempt to get everything right when he climbs Taipei 101, a 1,667-foot-tall skyscraper in Taiwan, without a rope. With Netflix livestreaming the climb, this niche pursuit has never received such global publicity before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling skyscrapers is not like rock climbing or going up smaller buildings. Those in the club of just a dozen or so known skyscraper climbers worldwide say it has unique and intense physical and mental demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also a largely underground sport because it is usually illegal. Alain Robert, a Frenchman who has scaled some 200 buildings since the 1990s, mostly with his bare hands, said that he has been arrested more than 170 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You feel like you’re literally in a movie,” Mr. Robert said, with “cops that are trying to catch the bad guy climbing the building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious risks make it rare for someone to obtain permission to climb a tall building like Mr. Honnold did. “I’ve never been willing to get arrested,” the 40-year-old said in a recent podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the serene natural landscape surrounding climbers on routes like El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, which Mr. Honnold scaled in 2017, skyscraper climbers must overcome urban noise, crowds and, occasionally, police officers determined to arrest them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You feel like King Kong in the city,” said Titouan Leduc, 24, a French climber who scaled Warsaw’s Varso Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the European Union, last year. He was briefly arrested after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have climbed skyscrapers say their bodies face different demands compared with rock climbing. According to Mr. Goodwin, 70, it mainly comes down to repetitiveness versus variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a rock face, each move presents a new puzzle: climbers’ hands search for different holds — crimps, jugs, slopers — and they constantly adapt their bodies. But along the side of a building, climbers repeat the same few movements hundreds of times to pass over dozens of stories of windows, steel bars and concrete gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can do a pull-up and think it’s not all too bad, but try doing 20, 50, 100,” Mr. Goodwin said. “Doing the same kind of move over and over and over — it can really tax your muscles and fingers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over decades, Mr. Robert, 63, developed his own system for rating buildings based on how difficult they are to climb. A building’s grips mattered more than its height, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave the Brooklyn Bridge a difficulty rating of two out of 10 after climbing it in 1994. He gave the same rating to the Eiffel Tower, which he scaled with his bare hands in 1996. “It’s really like a ladder,” he said of the Paris landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also the last person to climb Taipei 101, in 2004, then the tallest building in the world. He completed the climb just days after having surgery on his left elbow, in heavy rain and with a top rope, which he said the authorities had required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Robert gave Taipei 101 a rating of six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the small gaps on the surface of the Sydney Opera House, which he climbed in 1997 and rated as a seven, allowed him to hold on only with his fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1999, Mr. Robert scaled what he said was one of the most difficult buildings he had ever climbed, rating it a nine: the Sears Tower, now called the Willis Tower, in Chicago. He gave the Burj Khalifa in the United Arab Emirates, the world’s tallest building, the same grade after climbing it in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult building he ever encountered? A relatively humble 44-story office building west of Paris in 1998. He said the only way up the Framatome, now called the Tour Areva, is by jamming one’s fingers into a vertical groove between glass panels. Halfway through that climb, he said, the crack unexpectedly became so narrow that his fingers could barely fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like your entire life is hanging at the tip of your finger,” he said. He rated that difficulty a 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some climbers said they were concerned that Mr. Honnold’s climb, carried live on Netflix, would encourage reckless, untrained attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My message to kids: Don’t do it,” Mr. Goodwin said. “Unless you’re a world-class climber like Alex Honnold and Alain Robert, unless you have that ability, it’s a suicide mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For others, the danger keeps them going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only way I felt alive was when I was risking my life,” Mr. Robert said, adding that he might try climbing another building in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24themorning-nl/24themorning-nl-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed in an Airbnb recently and encountered the usual dysphoria one feels when occupying strangers’ homes: How can it be so difficult to unlock a front door, where are the lights, should I have taken my shoes off before running to the restroom, and, for me, the most perplexing, why is it so cold in here, and how on earth do I manipulate this weird thermostat? Regulating one’s temperature this time of year is, in much of the Northern Hemisphere, a fundamental challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O, to truly understand the sneaky calculus that determines “real feel” — the weather app said 40s, but I didn’t count on the wind! Layers, you tell yourself before leaving the house, but how many can one reasonably layer under a down parka before locomotion becomes impossible? I saw a headline from T Magazine and clicked eagerly, hoping it would solve things: “How to Stay Warm This Winter,” a list of luxurious accessories that promise to make things tolerable now that “we’ve reached the part of winter where it’s just you versus the elements.” I don’t know that I can justify cashmere earmuffs this year, but maybe over-the-knee socks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution, I’m told, is to become a tea person (the Brits just call this “a person”). Tea people, like sauna people, understand that warming oneself is not a layering challenge, but a cellular one. You could armor yourself with sealskin mittens and a down coat indistinguishable from a mountaineer’s sleeping bag, or you could mainline hot liquids and alter your temperature from the inside out. Tea people always have a mug going, a thermos at hand for refills. They carry out their all-day-long, all-day-strong warming ritual in the background, without the fanfare of coffee drinkers with their single-serving special orders. If they’re queried about their tea habits, they may, to the tea-ignorant, come off as a tad smug, like people with established yoga practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the late-2010s craze for “hygge,” the Danish concept of coziness and comfortable well-being? The Scandinavians, the rest of the world realized, might know a thing or two about optimizing for winter. They know from long, dark seasons, but still rank as the happiest people on the planet. Kari Leibowitz, a psychologist who moved north of the Arctic Circle to study how people thrive there during winter, wrote in The Times in 2020 that the secret is a “positive wintertime mind-set.” It’s possible, she found, to cultivate this, even if you’ve always associated the season with dread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mind-set shift involves changing what you notice, what you remark upon, where you place your focus. Leibowitz advises concentrating on what you like about winter (cooking, cozy indoor reading, the quiet after snowfall) over what you don’t (don’t get me started). “Appoint yourself a wintertime ambassador this year,” she advised, “and encourage everyone around you to notice what they like about the winter as well.” I imagine this self-designation might read as irritating to one’s shivering friends and family who would prefer to partake in the time-honored January tradition of complaining about the weather, but I’m already the unofficial publicist for summer, so maybe a new seasonal enthusiasm would read as refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leibowitz also advises people to get outside, to figure out the layering situation such that experiencing the Norwegian concept of “friluftsliv,” or “open air life,” isn’t excruciating. The Swedish author of “There’s No Such Thing as Bad Weather” (I think that sentence usually completes with “only bad clothes”) told Leibowitz, “There are some days when it’s harder to get outside than others, but I know that if I do, I’m never going to regret going outside.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah! That penetrates, doesn’t it? You’re never going to regret going outside. This is the sort of mantra that works on me. Every fiber of my being may disagree with it, but if I allow my brain to override the resistance, if I believe intellectually that it’s true, I’ll go out in the cold and quite possibly discover the physical and mental benefits of “outdoorphins.” If I can take a break from my usual winter pastimes of turning up the thermostat when no one is looking and making others touch and offer sympathy for my corpse-cold extremities, there’s a different relationship with winter awaiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re never going to regret going outside. No regrets, only possibility. You don’t have to make snow angels or take up cold-water swimming — just get your good clothes on and get out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, ICE agents patrolling Minneapolis collided with a car piloted by two teenagers. Agents detained the teens, and a crowd quickly formed. A local photographer texted Vincent Alban, a Times photography fellow covering Minneapolis. Alban sped over from a mile away and was taking pictures when ICE pushed one protester to the ground. With three agents on top of the demonstrator, another squirted pepper spray in his face. “The actual paper spray was an extremely fleeting moment, it couldn’t have been a second long,” Vincent recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, he and his camera were present. “The thing I love about photojournalism is that you have to be there in order to do your job,” he said. “It’s a firsthand account: What I’m seeing is what I’m photographing. With that I hope it’s seen as truthful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wide-scale protests against ICE shut down parts of Minneapolis-St. Paul yesterday. Thousands of demonstrators marched, hundreds of businesses closer their doors, and scores of workers and students stayed home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An F.B.I. agent who tried to investigate the ICE officer who shot Renee Good has resigned, after leadership pressured her to drop the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A majority of Americans, including 7 in 10 independents, believe ICE’s tactics have gone too far, a Times/Siena University poll found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter Storm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest storm of the winter is making its way across the U.S., with Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas in its path today. Cities are scrambling to stockpile road salt, airlines are canceling flights and some schools have pre-emptively canceled classes for early next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🗡️🧙‍♂️👑 “The Lord of the Rings” (in theaters): The first film in the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy came out 25 years ago, and the series has briefly returned to theaters to mark the occasion. Last weekend I took my son, a second grader, to see the first installment, “The Fellowship of the Ring.” He was captivated, thrilled, a little frightened. I was, too, even though I had watched it on DVD so many times I’d lost count. These are movies made to be seen on a big screen, though, if you’re snowed in, they’re pretty great on a small screen, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this weekend’s winter storm is keeping you close to the warmth of your kitchen, consider simmering a pot of Ali Slagle’s five-star farro and bean chili. Nontraditional but extremely satisfying, the farro in this vegan recipe has a nubby texture that recalls ground meat, and its starchiness helps thicken the mix. And if you like your chili on the fiery side, add a couple of minced chipotle chiles in adobo sauce or double the chili power. That’ll be sure to warm you right up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great chef’s knife can revolutionize daily meal prep. When you’re ready for an upgrade, start by thinking about your cutting style: Do you prefer to rock along the blade as you cut? Then German knives, which have a more pronounced curve, are best. However, if you tend to make individual slices — meaning the blade leaves the board after each cut — then the flatter belly curve of a Japanese knife is best. We’ve chopped over 70 pounds of produce to find the best chef’s knives in both styles. And once you’ve invested in a great one, a bit of care and maintenance, like hand-washing and regular sharpening, can keep it in good shape for decades. — Lesley Stockton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles Rams vs. Seattle Seahawks, N.F.C. Championship: The last two teams standing in the N.F.C. are well acquainted. In November, the Rams knocked off the Seahawks, 21-19. A month later the Seahawks won the rematch, topping the Rams 38-37 in an overtime thriller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Part 3. The Seahawks are coming in hot. Last week they crushed the 49ers, 41-6, in a game that served as a showcase for their stellar defense — the “Dark Side,” as they call it. In fact, in the past couple of months, only one team has really been able to crack the Seattle defense: the Rams, with their M.V.P. front-runner quarterback Matthew Stafford. This game, The Athletic’s Michael-Shawn Dugar writes, “will be the Dark Side’s toughest test of the season.”&lt;/p&gt;

Foege, Key Figure in the Eradication of Smallpox, Dies at 89</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/william-h-foege-dead.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/01/obituaries/00Foege1/00Foege1-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William H. Foege, who developed the vaccination strategy that helped wipe out smallpox in the 1970s, one of the world’s greatest public health triumphs, and who led the United States’ early response to the AIDS epidemic as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, died on Saturday night at his home in Atlanta. He was 89.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mark Rosenberg, a friend and colleague, said the cause was congestive heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among public health professionals, Dr. Foege was almost without peer — the grand old man of public health, a field that many feel is under siege by the Trump administration. His successors at the C.D.C., the nation’s primary public health agency, often sought his counsel. In 2012, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest honor given to a civilian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As director of the C.D.C. under two presidents — Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, and Ronald Reagan, a Republican — Dr. Foege put forth an expansive vision for the agency. He had it focus on leading killers beyond infectious disease, including auto injuries and gun violence, the latter bringing the C.D.C. into conflict with the National Rifle Association and Republicans on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving the agency in 1983, he created programs that sharply increased childhood vaccinations on a global scale. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former New York City health commissioner who later ran the C.D.C. under Mr. Obama, invoked a baseball superlative when preparing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for a meeting with Dr. Foege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I said, ‘Basically, he’s the Babe Ruth of public health,’” Dr. Frieden recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tall as an N.B.A. forward (he was 6-foot-7) and graced with a patient manner as the son of an Iowa minister, Dr. Foege was serving as a Lutheran Church missionary doctor in Africa when, in 1966, the World Health Organization launched an international program to eradicate smallpox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W.H.O. program in West and Central Africa was initially administered by the C.D.C., and it was recruiting as many doctors as it could find to help set up an eradication project in eastern Nigeria. Dr. Foege, who at 29 had earned a master’s degree in public health only the year before, was invited to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with his wife and a young son, Dr. Foege (pronounced FAY-gee, with a hard “g”) moved to Enugu, the region’s capital. They lived in a four-room mud-walled hut with “no electricity, no running water, no indoor bathroom,” Dr. Foege recalled in an interview in 2023. The nearest telephone was 90 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, working as a consultant with Dr. Donald A. Henderson, the W.H.O. smallpox program leader, and Dr. J. Donald Millar, director of the C.D.C. eradication project in West Africa, Dr. Foege trained and deployed teams of specialists determined to vaccinate as many people as possible. At the time, West Africa was considered the most intractable smallpox region in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly contagious, often disfiguring and deadly, smallpox had killed as many as 500 million people throughout history. An infected person would be covered with sores of oozing pus and blood that smelled like decomposing flesh. Dr. Foege said he could smell smallpox the minute he entered a room. It was “the scent of death,” he said in a recent podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional modern approach to controlling the disease was vaccination of everybody in an infected region. It was effective as long as there was an adequate supply of vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 1966, Dr. Foege was summoned to control a smallpox outbreak 90 miles east of Enugu. But unable to acquire enough vaccine to inoculate everyone in the area, he proposed a more efficient, surgical approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His team identified those infected in the villages, isolated them, and vaccinated everyone who had been in contact with them. They then vaccinated everyone who had been in contact with that second group. As a next step, they vaccinated people who had gathered in primary public places, like markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, Dr. Foege and his team built a ring of containment around the initial outbreak, halting the spread of the disease. He said the strategy — now known as “ring vaccination” — was based on principles he learned when he spent summers fighting wildfires in the American West as a younger man. Fire crews worked to extinguish the heart of the fire while trying to prevent its spread by building fire lines, perimeters cleared of vegetation, often down to bare soil.&lt;/p&gt;

We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t a new strategy,” Dr. Foege said in an interview for this obituary in 2020. “What was important was that we got rid of the first strategy, which was mass vaccination. We showed that you could forget about mass vaccination and go right to the second part.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When civil war broke out in Nigeria, pitting secessionists in the east against the federal government in Lagos, Dr. Foege’s family was evacuated. But Dr. Foege, having rejoined the C.D.C., stayed behind in the eastern region to lead the effort to stamp out smallpox there. It was dangerous work: He was constantly encountering roadblocks, often maintained by armed teenage rebels, who, he later wrote, “mixed guns, alcohol and bravado.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When officials in Lagos cut off vaccine supplies to the east, threatening the success of his program, Dr. Foege was defiant, and undeterred. He and one of his C.D.C. team members hopped in his white Dodge pickup truck and drove 350 miles, across a bridge over the Niger River and into the capital city to raid a government warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While his C.D.C. colleague distracted a security guard, Dr. Foege loaded up the truck with stolen vaccine, cold packs, jet injector parts and other supplies. He drove back, terrified of being caught — only to run into a wall of trucks and bulldozers blocking the bridge at the river’s western edge, cutting off his passage back to safety. He fast-talked his way through in a meeting with the rebel leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I explained that we had just stolen vaccine from the federal government, and he was happy about that,” Dr. Foege recalled in an interview with The New York Times in 2023. “He cleared a path for us, and when we got across the bridge, we could breathe a sigh of relief.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the summer of 1967, smallpox had been eradicated in eastern Nigeria, and Dr. Foege reported the results at a C.D.C. meeting in Ghana. Dr. Millar and his C.D.C. specialists in Africa soon embraced the containment approach as the primary tactic for eradicating smallpox in West and Central Africa, a goal that was achieved in the spring of 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foege, as a C.D.C. consultant, was next dispatched, in 1973, to help design and lead smallpox eradication projects in India, one of the last countries where the disease still had a hold. He had served as a Peace Corps volunteer in India in the early 1960s and was familiar with the country. Again, his family, which had grown by two more sons, accompanied him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge in India was consistent with what he had learned in Africa. Working with the Indian national and state authorities, he shuttled between planning meetings and the field as a senior leader in an eradication program that grew to enlist tens of thousands of investigators and technicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of villages where the disease was present, along with the number of new smallpox infections, began to fall in 1974, when political interference almost derailed the project. The minister of health in the northeast state of Bihar had become alarmed at what he viewed as a slow pace in controlling infections and vowed to replace the surveillance-containment program with mass vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing so would have wasted months of logistics preparation, training and early successes in reducing infections. “Did he have any idea that he was threatening to put the entire India program, indeed the entire global program, in jeopardy?” Dr. Foege wrote in “House on Fire: The Fight to Eradicate Smallpox (2011), one of several books he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a meeting with the minister to decide the issue in May 1974, a young Indian doctor, a field technician for the project, stood up and described himself as just a poor village man. In the event of a fire, he said, no one in his village poured water on houses that weren’t burning. Instead, as in the surveillance-containment strategy, they poured water only on the burning house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A chill went up my spine,” Dr. Foege wrote. “This man condensed all the work, discussions, discoveries and massive human effort of the previous seven months into a few words and the indelible image of a fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bihar minister backed off. A year later, the last case of smallpox in India was eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world’s last known smallpox case was that of a cook in Somalia in 1978, Dr. Foege said. Two years later, the W.H.O. formally declared that smallpox was the first infectious disease to be altogether eliminated. Dr. Foege, Dr. Henderson and Dr. Millar are widely credited with being the principal architects of that eradication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the three, Dr. Foege was the last survivor. Dr. Millar died in 2015, Dr. Henderson in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foege was appointed to direct the C.D.C. in 1977, during the Carter administration. Four years later, the C.D.C. published the first reports of a “rare cancer” in homosexual men — the first hint of the coming AIDS epidemic. Dr. Foege, grappling with budget cuts and an indifferent Reagan White House, “borrowed money and borrowed people” from other programs, he said, to build a task force of epidemiologists to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next two years, until he left the C.D.C., Dr. Foege navigated the political currents in Washington around a highly charged epidemic, as scientists raced to identify the virus causing the so-called “gay cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He privately pushed his higher-ups at the Department of Health and Human Services to ask Congress for more funding. When they refused, he told lawmakers that the C.D.C. had what it needed. When Democrats in Congress wanted him to provide the names of men infected, Dr. Foege refused, saying patients deserved their privacy. He stepped down in 1983, he said in an interview, partly out of frustration with the Reagan White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving government, Dr. Foege focused on strengthening global health programs for children. In 1984, a working group composed of members of the W.H.O., UNICEF, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program and the Rockefeller Foundation recruited him to lead what was christened the Task Force for Child Survival, based in Atlanta, its mission to increase global immunization of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the task force started, roughly 15 percent of the world’s children had received at least one vaccine. By 1990, the rate had increased to 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foege often said that all public health is global health, by which he meant that infectious disease knows no borders. He spoke frequently of the moral obligation to be a “good ancestor,” said Dr. Rosenberg, who worked with Dr. Foege at the C.D.C. and is president emeritus of the task force, since renamed the Task Force for Global Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He thought that public health has a basic responsibility to take care of not just the people right next to us, but everybody,” Dr. Rosenberg added, “and he expanded that concept of everybody in the world to everybody who’s going to be born in the future. That was a tremendous leap, a visionary statement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1986, Mr. Carter and his wife, the former first lady Rosalynn Carter, named Dr. Foege executive director of the Carter Center, a nongovernmental organization in Atlanta focused on global conflict and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bill Foege was a pre-eminent public health practitioner who dedicated his life to what he called science in the service of humanity,” Mr. Carter said in a statement for this obituary, issued before his own death in December 2024. “He saved the lives of millions of people around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Herbert Foege was born on March 12, 1936, in Decorah, Iowa. He was the eldest of two boys and the third eldest of six children raised in a series of parsonages by his parents, the Rev. William A. and Anne Erika Foege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He received a B.A. in biology from Pacific Lutheran University, in Parkland, Wash., in 1957, and a medical degree from the University of Washington in 1961. He spent a short time with the Peace Corps in India and received a master’s degree in public health from Harvard University in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, Dr. Foege joined the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta as a professor of international health. Two years later, as Bill and Melinda Gates were preparing to launch their world health foundation, Mr. Gates recruited Dr. Foege to develop programs to fight disease. As a senior fellow with the foundation for 10 years, he influenced its decision to invest $750 million to start a public-private global child-vaccination project called Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foege was described by friends and colleagues as someone who was comfortable with taking risks in pursuit of a goal, a trait that perhaps helped explain one of the few missteps of his career: his defense of the failed blood-testing technology promoted by Theranos, the Silicon Valley start-up founded by Elizabeth Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, two years after he joined the company’s board and as the effectiveness of the Theranos technology was coming under intense scrutiny, Dr. Foege published an opinion article on the political news site The Hill. “In my opinion, the very foundation of Theranos’ inventions — and its hundreds of patents — is credible,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2018, six months before Theranos collapsed, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ms. Holmes with fraud for misleading investors about the capabilities of the technology and overstating the company’s revenues. In 2022, she was found guilty on four of 11 counts of fraud and sentenced to a little more than 11 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foege’s honors included the 1996 Calderone Prize, the most prestigious public health award; and the 2005 Public Welfare Medal, the National Academy of Science’s highest award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survivors include his wife, Paula (Ristad) Foege; two sons, Robert and Michael; three sisters, Mildred Toepel, Annette Stixrud and Carolyn Hellberg; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. His eldest son, David, died in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his later years, Dr. Foege became a prominent critic of both the first and second Trump administrations’ actions regarding public health. In 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic was sweeping the world, he criticized the White House for initially downplaying the threat and making inaccurate public statements about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve broken every rule that we’ve learned on disease control,” he said in the interview for this obituary that year. “The first and most important rule is to know the truth. You have to set up a surveillance system to know the truth, otherwise you’re responding blindly. The truth changes every day in the White House.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was furious with the current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has taken steps to dismantle many of the programs that Dr. Foege helped build, and whose views on vaccination he regarded as dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kennedy’s words can be as lethal as the smallpox virus,” he wrote in an opinion piece for the health and science website STAT in August, after Mr. Kennedy had promoted cod liver oil as a treatment for measles and called vaccination a personal choice. In an email message at the time, he wrote, “I had no idea I would be this angry at the age of 89.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a single accomplishment for which Dr. Foege will be remembered, it is the eradication of smallpox, which killed 300 million people in the 20th century alone. Among the books on his living room coffee table was one published in 2009 and titled “Scientists Greater Than Einstein: The Biggest Lifesavers of the Twentieth Century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book tells the stories of 10 scientists who were not famous, but whose work had an outsize impact on humanity. The cover drawing is a silhouette of those featured inside. There are no names, but Dr. Foege’s presence is obvious. He stands a head taller than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/00int-denmark-leader-pfbm/00int-denmark-leader-pfbm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mette Frederiksen has never tolerated bullies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was in high school, Ms. Frederiksen, Denmark’s prime minister, stood up to a pack of skinheads for teasing immigrant kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t go so well. She got socked in the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this week, she ducked a punch, a big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After escalating threats from President Trump about seizing Greenland, Denmark’s gigantic overseas territory, Mr. Trump seems finally to have backed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a speech to the world’s financial elite in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would not use force to take Greenland. Later he said he and NATO leaders had worked out “the framework of a future deal” that would make everyone happy. That remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there were other factors to Mr. Trump’s reversal, like rising congressional opposition and falling stock markets, but there’s no doubt that Ms. Frederiksen’s carefully crafted defense helped block Mr. Trump from getting something he really wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, Ms. Frederiksen has played a nervous game of brinkmanship with Mr. Trump, and it looks like she has won — for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As negotiations continue, Ms. Frederiksen remains locked in an unwanted struggle, trying to calibrate how to make clear to the mercurial Mr. Trump that the answer to his demand that the United States have Greenland is a hard no, without antagonizing him into threatening to snatch it away again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, she has signaled her resistance to one of the compromises that Mr. Trump appeared to be considering — the establishment of American sovereignty over military bases on Greenland. Sovereignty, she insists, remains a “red line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent time with Ms. Frederiksen this fall, in Greenland, where she agreed to a rare sit-down interview in an old house overlooking the sea. We asked her if she felt Mr. Trump was acting like a bully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is able to speak in a very clear way,” she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So am I.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That quiet resolve, rather than flattery, has set her apart from other European leaders when it comes to handling Mr. Trump. It has made her extraordinarily popular at home. Opinion polls in Denmark show her party surging. Elections are later this year and the polls suggest she’s primed to win a third term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her rising support reflects just how much Greenland means for her country, let alone for Mr. Trump and Greenlanders themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Mr. Trump, the island represents the extreme of his imperial ambitions: seizing an enormous land from a NATO ally in what would be the biggest territorial acquisition in American history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 57,000 Greenlanders, a mostly Inuit population with long and complicated ties to Denmark, their future is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for Ms. Frederiksen, who swept into office in 2019 as the youngest prime minister in Danish history, the dispute is undeniably existential, threatening her country’s very identity, composition and stature on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s fast-moving developments demonstrated her tactical skills. After Mr. Trump, declared that since he didn’t win the Nobel Peace Prize he was giving up on peace and would push ahead on Greenland, she rolled up her sleeves, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She imported troops from her own coalition of the willing — including Britain, Germany, France and Iceland — to Greenland. She rallied Europe to speak out in Denmark’s defense. She resisted Mr. Trump’s threats of tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until that moment, many Danes had resigned themselves that there was little their country could do if indeed Mr. Trump moved on the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen’s risky strategy to call in foreign troops, albeit a tiny contingent of a few dozen and ostensibly part of an Arctic training exercise, was a signal that any military action that Mr. Trump took “would be very nasty and ugly,” said Bent Winther, a Danish political commentator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her point was that, “if you’re going to take Greenland by force, you’d have to put British and French and German officers in handcuffs,” Mr. Winther said. “I think that was part of the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen’s sparring with Mr. Trump has come to define her leadership. It started from her very first weeks in office in 2019, when she arrived at the age of 41 as the head of the center-left Social Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That summer, during his first term, Mr. Trump suggested that the United States buy Greenland, which has been part of Denmark for more than 300 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen dismissed it as “absurd,” which provoked Mr. Trump to cancel a trip to Copenhagen and call her remarks “nasty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does she regret saying that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a closed chapter,” she said in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Trump reopened that chapter again, on Jan. 7, 2025, even before his inauguration, when he said for the first time that he wouldn’t rule out using military force to get Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same day, the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., made a lightning quick visit to Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, in the depths of winter, ostensibly for business. His appearance drew a band of pro-Trump social media influencers dressed in bulky snowsuits and American flags who passed out $100 bills, which turned off many Greenlanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next week, Ms. Frederiksen held a heated phone call with Mr. Trump. According to European officials who were briefed afterward, Mr. Trump berated her for 45 minutes. She did not want to talk about that one either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A phone call between two colleagues has to be a phone call between two colleagues,” she told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Winther, who co-wrote a biography about her — “Mette F” — in 2019, traces her cool self-assuredness and penchant for underdog causes to her childhood home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father, Flemming Frederiksen, was a typographer, union leader and active member of the Social Democrats. He worked in a newspaper production room as the paper was transitioning into the automated era and stood up for workers about to be rendered obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people ask me: ‘When did you get interested in politics?’ I don’t know what to say,” Ms. Frederiksen said during our interview. “I cannot remember not being interested in politics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was shy, she said, but also strident. After recounting the run-in with the skinhead in high school, she said, “I don’t know if it tells something about my character, maybe it tells us more about his.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first political party she joined was the youth wing of the African National Congress. She rapidly rose through the ranks of the youth wing of the Social Democrats, winning a seat in 2001 to Denmark’s parliament. Mr. Winter said she arrived with “extraordinary confidence, you know, the confidence you can only feel when you are very young.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, she had a different look — casual clothes, spiky hair. She quickly gained a reputation for being a strong public speaker and unafraid of taking on party elders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her tenure has been marked by crisis. During the Covid pandemic her government abruptly ordered a cull of millions of minks (raised for fur), fearful they could spread the virus. It was a controversial decision and resulted in several high-level resignations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She survived the fallout and ultimately was credited with guiding Denmark through those years with relatively low infections while keeping public services as open as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Vladimir V. Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, she called for Europe to act. She was among the first on the continent to commit F-16 fighter jets to the Ukrainian military and boosted weapons production for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her country, like some others, has been the victim of unsolved drone incursions widely believed to have been instigated by Russia, perhaps as payback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On immigration, she has put in place some of Europe’s harshest asylum rules — including utilizing camps abroad and family separations. The moves have been criticized by human rights groups but have sharply reduced arrivals and shored her up politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we spoke with her in September, she was visiting Greenland to apologize for Danish doctors forcing contraception on Greenlandic women and girls, part of a long abusive colonial legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Danish political analysts give her high marks for how she has handled Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s difficult for me to really find any major errors,” said Ulrik Pram Grad, a respected academic on Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Grad said that as Mr. Trump began to get aggressive about Greenland, Ms. Frederiksen did a good job of coordinating with Greenlandic officials and rallying European capitals, such as London and Paris, “trying to get our message out of other people’s mouths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason? Denmark needs Greenland. With it, Denmark is the world’s 12th largest sovereign state. It sits on the Arctic Council, the leading international forum for Arctic affairs. It keeps its special (though now troubled) relationship to the United States, which has been protecting Greenland since World War II and maintains a military base at the northern end of the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When they don’t have Greenland anymore, they will lose 98 percent of their area,” said Pele Broberg, the leader of a Greenlandic political party that has been critical of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So it’s very simple,” Mr. Broberg said. “They’re important as long as they own us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Frederiksen, for her part, has supported Greenland’s autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The future of Greenland belongs to the Greenlandic people,” she said. “It’s more two countries now working together than an old colony, with all what is included in that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 50-minute interview, Ms. Frederiksen was more comfortable talking foreign affairs than about her own life. She is on her second marriage, with a Danish cinematographer, Bo Tengberg, and together they are raising five children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside politics, she finds respite in spending time at the family summer house, cooking and preserving food, and staying fit through spinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said one of her most important guiding principles was keeping Europe’s alliance with America strong — or at least intact. As recently as 2024, she said that she wouldn’t allow “a single piece of paper” to slip between the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past week, she has said that she still believes in a close relationship with the United States, citing “a common interest in ensuring our security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some Europeans have loved the U.S. because of dollars and ‘Dallas’ and so on. That’s not how I am,” she told us. “I really believe that everything would have gone wrong for Europe if it wasn’t for D-Day and for the big role of the U.S. in ending the Second World War.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You saved us,” she said. “And by the way, you have done that again and again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So my starting point is that I will do whatever I can to keep us together in this world, and therefore I’m not starting a conflict,” she said. “I’m trying to solve a conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/31/multimedia/00int-france-podcast-01-wbkq/00int-france-podcast-01-wbkq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past fall, the French podcaster Philippe Collin traveled with his millions of listeners to an enormous, almost 900-year-old castle in southwestern Germany, where members of the Nazi-backed French collaborationist government retreated after the D-Day landings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the sound of laughter and clinking champagne glasses, Mr. Collin’s listeners heard how the French collaborators celebrated Christmas in the castle’s grand mirrored gallery during the last year of World War II and planned their return to Paris on the backs of German tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a part of French history that is little known, decidedly inglorious and — to many in France — best forgotten. Yet by making podcasts about it, as part of a broader series about France’s checkered World War II history, Mr. Collin has become among the most popular podcasters in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His podcast, “Facing History,” has proved an unlikely but smashing success, passing 40 million downloads. Among historians and politicians, it has spurred reappraisals of key historical figures. And, amid fears of an expansion of Russia’s war farther into Europe and the growing popularity of the French far right, Mr. Collin hopes it will burrow into the minds of his listeners and inspire them to defend the soul of the French Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am trying to reactivate the memory of the resistance,” Mr. Collin explained over coffee recently, referring to the French underground movements that resisted the Nazis during the German occupation of much of France in 1940-45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Collin, 50, has spent his career as a producer and host of France’s most popular radio station, France Inter, where he built a reputation as an innovator and someone keen to try new things. Over the years, he has hosted shows as varied as the afternoon daily talk show and a weekly program on American culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than four years, his focus has been historical podcast series, many at least partly dedicated to France’s delicate, complicated experience of World War II, as both a victim of Nazi Germany and a collaborator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each series of “Facing History” lasts eight to 10 hours and is packed with archival radio clips, snatches of letters and memoirs read by actors, and interviews with as many as 12 historians. Despite — or perhaps because of — their uncomfortable subjects and rigorous treatment, the shows have proved popular. The series on the German castle has been downloaded more than two million times. Mr. Collin’s 2024 novel, “The Barman of the Ritz,” was so popular, its cover went back onto Paris subway walls in January to announce the paperback version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podcast has given him material for three spinoff books, three television documentaries and a nine-hour play about Léon Blum, France’s first Jewish prime minister, who was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp. Two more plays based on the series are in the works, and historians credit Mr. Collin with finding new information for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Rousso, a celebrated French historian of World War II, said that even he learned things while listening to Mr. Collin’s podcasts. “For me, he is an historian,” said Mr. Rousso, who has appeared on three of the podcasts. “He has the ability to create a historical narrative that is uniquely his own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all historians agree. Mr. Collin caused an uproar among experts on France’s war in Algeria after the podcast downplayed reports that Jean-Marie Le Pen, a far-right leader, tortured Algerians during the conflict. After the podcast, a confession by Mr. Le Pen, published posthumously, acknowledged the reports were true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Collin “dabbles in everything, and like all people who dabble in everything, he very often doesn’t really know what he’s talking about,” said Fabrice Riceputi, a historian who was motivated by the podcast to write a book documenting Mr. Le Pen’s torture of Algerians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French passion for its national history can explain some of the series’ success. But Mr. Collin thinks the country’s current mood has made it particularly receptive to these stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podcast began less than a year before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and fears of a larger war, engulfing France, have since grown. At the same time, France’s far-right party has surged. Polls show that one of its leaders would win the next presidential election in 2027, which would create the first far-right government in France since the collaborationist Vichy regime in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People have a sense the Republic is threatened again and are looking for tools to combat that,” Mr. Collin said. Adding to that sense of social anxiety, he said, are the deaths of the last remaining heroes from the war — “the guardians of the memory of the resistance,” as he calls them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are in the process of breaking away from that past,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By his own admission, Mr. Collin is “obsessed” with that past. He was trained as a historian, doing his master’s degree on the purge of suspected collaborators near the end of World War II. He would have continued had his parents had the money to keep funding his studies, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in 1975, he grew up in the tiny village of Le Fret in Brittany, the eldest of two sons of a mother who was a child care assistant and a father who worked in the navy. Like many in France, the family was haunted by the history of the war. Both of his grandfathers had been captured soldiers. Meals with the extended family were peppered with their stories, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there was the discovery of a terrible family secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His favorite great-uncle, Marcel Grob, whom he visited every summer in the Alsace region, had fought with the Waffen S.S. — the fanatical Nazi unit known for civilian massacres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he learned the truth, Mr. Collin cut his great-uncle off. He didn’t attend Mr. Grob’s funeral, he said, because he thought to himself, “I’m not going to the funeral of a Nazi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, he received Mr. Grob’s military service record and realized he had made a painful mistake. Mr. Grob, then just 17, had been a forced conscript. Through research, Mr. Collin learned that the families of conscripts who evaded their orders were sent to German labor camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All of a sudden, I said to myself, ‘What would you have done in his place?’” Mr. Collin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, he published a graphic novel, “The Journey of Marcel Grob,” as a form of apology. He spent eight years writing “Barman of the Ritz,” about a Jewish bartender during the war who served Nazis at night and found fake papers for Jewish employees by day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Collin has two stepsons with his partner, Sonia Devillers, another well-known radio journalist at France Inter. He said one of them recently asked him if he thought about the war every single day. “I said yes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his podcasts are often about much more. With his team of 10, he has examined Napoleon, the writer Molière and Louis XV’s official mistress, Jeanne de Barry. His latest series is about the Statue of Liberty, a gift to the United States from the French public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His podcast on the life of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish Army captain wrongly convicted of treason in the late 19th century, helped inspire a French lawmaker to sponsor a law that gave Mr. Dreyfus a posthumous promotion. “I listened to the entirety of Philippe Collin’s podcast,” the lawmaker, Charles Sitzenstuhl, said in an email. “It made a deep impression on me and helped me in my work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there were a drum beat to the series, it would be what Mr. Collin calls the “values of the French Republic.” By that, he means liberty, equality and fraternity — the country’s motto, born during the French Revolution in 1789 — as well as the societal systems that ensure the promise is kept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worries those values are being attacked and sees France’s current divisions as an echo of those of the 1930s, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, we are facing a form of radicalization and polarization within society, and we can clearly see the seeds of a civil war — an ideological civil war — being replanted,” he said. “We are losing our way, much like the United States, for that matter. People in the United States can no longer speak to each other.” There, he said, “the ‘other’ is no longer a human being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hopes his podcast offers listeners a kind of antidote. But, he said, he remains humble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We aren’t in politics,” he said. “We are just a podcast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-china-military-mvfl/24int-china-military-mvfl-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China’s top general, second only to Xi Jinping, the nation’s leader, in the military command, has been put under investigation and accused of “grave violations of discipline and the law,” the Ministry of National Defense said on Saturday, the most stunning escalation yet in Mr. Xi’s purge of the People’s Liberation Army elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general, Zhang Youxia, is a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, the Communist Party body that controls China’s armed forces. Another member of the commission, Gen. Liu Zhenli, who leads the military’s Joint Staff Department, is also under investigation, the Defense Ministry said. Its announcement did not say what either general was alleged to have done wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang’s downfall — few if any Chinese officials placed publicly under investigation are later declared innocent — is the most drastic step so far in Mr. Xi’s yearslong campaign to root out what he has described as corruption and disloyalty in the military’s senior ranks. It is all the more astonishing because General Zhang seemed to be a confidant of Mr. Xi, who has known him for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This move is unprecedented in the history of the Chinese military and represents the total annihilation of the high command,” Christopher K. Johnson, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst who follows Chinese elite politics, said of the investigation of General Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the two generals effectively out, the Central Military Commission has just two members left: its chairman, Mr. Xi, and General Zhang Shengmin, who has overseen Mr. Xi’s military purges. Mr. Xi has now removed all but one of the six generals he appointed to the commission in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Johnson, the president of China Strategies Group, a consulting firm, said Mr. Xi seemed to have concluded that problems in the military ran so deep that he could not trust the top command to cure itself and must look to a new cohort of rising officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appears to have “decided he must cut very deep generationally to find a group not tainted,” Mr. Johnson said. “The purging of even a childhood friend in Zhang Youxia shows there now are no limits to Xi’s anti-graft zeal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors that the general might be in trouble had spread for days, since official news reports left clues that he and General Liu had been absent from a Communist Party meeting. But General Zhang has disappeared from view before, and a senior official is usually out of sight for months before the party confirms that he is under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed with which General Zhang’s ouster was announced seemed intended to staunch the potential damage for Mr. Xi, said Su Tzu-yun, an expert on the People’s Liberation Army, or P.L.A., at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, a body funded by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This could be a big blow to morale inside the P.L.A.,” Mr. Su said in an interview, referring to the removal of a seemingly invulnerable commander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang and General Liu were also the P.L.A.’s two top commanders for practical operational tasks, and their removal will leave a gap in experience, said Shanshan Mei, a political scientist at RAND, a research organization, who studies China’s armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no one right now at the highest level who has operational experience or who is in charge of training and exercises,” Ms. Mei said. “This is going to cut very deep, and there’s more to come, possibly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang, 75, had seemed to be cordoned off from Mr. Xi’s widening purges. The two men’s fathers, both veterans of Mao Zedong’s revolutionary wars, were personally acquainted, and Mr. Xi had kept General Zhang in office beyond the customary retirement age of about 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Xi’s worries about the trustworthiness of his commanders seemed to finally outweigh whatever attachment he felt to the general, Mr. Su said. “I think this reflects Xi Jinping’s personal sense of insecurity, and that’s a major factor in his purges of the military,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2023, waves of top commanders, officers and executives for arms manufacturers have been removed from office and placed under investigation — or, in some cases, have disappeared from view without explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first purges in that wave focused on China’s Rocket Force, which operates most of its nuclear missiles and many of its conventional ones. Ensuing investigations took down admirals, regional military commanders and members of the Central Military Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the targeted officers had been promoted by Mr. Xi since he took power in 2012, vowing to cleanse the armed forces of endemic graft. But after a decade in charge, he seemed to have concluded that some of his own handpicked protégés had been infected by the military’s corruption, which historically has often involved taking bribes for contracts or promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigations’ toll on the military was visible at a meeting last year of the Communist Party’s Central Committee, a council of top officials. Of the 44 uniformed officers appointed to the committee in 2022, 29 — roughly two-thirds — had been purged or were missing, according to calculations made by Neil Thomas, a researcher on Chinese politics at the Asia Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Xi seems to have calculated that in the longer term, his shake-up of the military will make it less corrupt, more loyal and more effective in pursuing his goals, like putting pressure on Taiwan, the island democracy that rejects China’s claims of sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now, and potentially for years, the disruptions caused by the purges could leave Mr. Xi less confident that his commanders are ready for combat, analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a dilemma,” said Mr. Su, the Taiwan-based analyst. “He wants to first get rid of these so-called corrupt people, but for the P.L.A., if you clear out these high-level officers, that means a whole lot of experience is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang was among the few Chinese commanders with extensive experience in battle. The son of a general, he gained prominence as a frontline officer during China’s last war, a border conflict with Vietnam that began in 1979 and lasted for years. He rose to become head of the General Armaments Department, which is in charge of procuring weapons, and Mr. Xi promoted him to the Central Military Commission in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For Zhang Youxia, having combat experience — and being one of the only left who has any — has to add to his luster, at least to Xi Jinping,” John Culver, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst specializing in the Chinese military, said in an interview before General Zhang’s dismissal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But analysts speculated that General Zhang’s time in the General Armaments Department — which, because it controls arms contracts, became known as a honey pot of corruption — may have planted the seeds of his downfall. Other generals who rose through that department have also been purged, including Li Shangfu, a former defense minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Xi may need years or more to nurture a new crop of — presumably — trustworthy officers, and he must also fill the depleted ranks of the Central Military Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To rebuild these chains of command may take him five years or longer,” Mr. Su said. “The chances of an attack on Taiwan in the short term have been lowered.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-iran-irgc01a-photo-gkhw/24int-iran-irgc01a-photo-gkhw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks after Israeli warplanes pounded Iran’s capital last June, the country’s top generals stood in their socks at the entrance of a mosque in northern Tehran, mourning the men who had been killed in the strikes — leaders who they would now replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strikes had caused the greatest single blow to Iran’s military in decades, wiping out the top leadership of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the feared praetorian guard to the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the question was how would this new generation of leaders, catapulted to the top, would guide the country through a singularly challenging period, including growing economic stress, the prospect of new international sanctions and regular threats of yet more military strikes from President Trump and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer came in recent weeks when those new leaders responded to nationwide protests with breathtaking brutality, opening fire on unarmed protesters and massacring thousands of people. At least one Iranian human rights group based in the United States said it had confirmed 5,002 deaths, including 207 members of the security forces, during the protests from Dec. 28 to mid-January. In their first official toll on Wednesday, the Iranian authorities said that 3,117 people had died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, the bloody crackdown affirmed the unity of Iran’s ruling system — centered on the ayatollah and the Revolutionary Guards, estimated to number about 150,000 — and its willingness to take ruthless action to ensure its survival. But Iran experts said the bloody response was also a sign of the system’s growing weakness, exposing the limits of Ayatollah Khamenei’s 37-year rule as he wrestles with surging domestic unrest and intense foreign pressure at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Mr. Trump said that an American “armada” was heading toward Iran, but that he hoped he would not have to use it. He again warned the Iranian government against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That combination of factors put the ruling system under immense strain, said Afshon Ostovar, an Iran expert at the Naval Postgraduate School in California and the author of “Vanguard of the Imam,” a history of the Revolutionary Guards. “Right off the bat, they saw the protests as an existential threat,” he said. “They turned to live fire really quickly because their weakness was acute, and they knew it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the ayatollah’s legitimacy under open challenge, the Revolutionary Guards are emerging as the core of the system. “You have this aging theocrat whose days are numbered,” Mr. Ostovar said. “And you have security forces that are taking an increasingly aggressive response to any threat to the regime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upheaval has renewed comparisons between the Islamic Republic and the Soviet Union in the 1980s, before it collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran has seldom faced a greater array of challenges. Its network of regional proxies, including Hezbollah and Hamas, is in tatters. Its contentious nuclear program, estimated to cost tens of billions of dollars, failed to bring deterrence. Supplies of water and electricity are running low. Edicts forcing Iranian women to wear head scarves, a symbolic totem of the ayatollah’s conservative rule, are being openly flouted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The regime is ideologically bankrupt, economically at a dead end, and unable to rescue itself,” said Ali Vaez, the Iran project director for the International Crisis Group, a research body. “But it still has the will, and a fearsome capacity for repression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ayatollah, who promised to strengthen the Islamic Republic after he came to power in 1989, has led the country into this predicament, critics say. His intransigence, rooted in resistance to the United States and Israel, but also in opposition to change at home, was once a pillar of his iron rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that approach is seen by some as a mark of vulnerability, even by some of his own supporters, and analysts say his authority is at its lowest in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American and Israeli airstrikes in June initially provoked a nationalist surge inside Iran, as people across the political spectrum united against foreign aggression. “All these stupid attacks by the Zionists have brought Iranians together,” Abdulkarim Alizadeh, a retired commander with the Revolutionary Guards, said last summer as he left the mosque in northern Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran’s enemies had “miscalculated” if they hoped the attacks would provoke a popular uprising, Kamal Kharazi, a senior adviser to the supreme leader, told The New York Times in July. “On the contrary,” he said, “the war led to national unity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are prepared for all scenarios,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But defiance soon gave way to economic reality as the United Nations imposed new sanctions on Iran, causing the national currency to collapse. Protests on Dec. 28 in Tehran’s the main bazaars — whose merchants played a central role in the 1979 revolution — quickly spread across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the balance of power in Iran has been quietly shifting from Ayatollah Khamenei, 86, to the Revolutionary Guards. They are not only a security behemoth. They control a media empire, large parts of the economy, oil exports, seaports, an intelligence agency and an air force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have everything that it takes to assume power,” Mr. Vaez said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One scenario is that a figure favored by the Revolutionary Guards would seize power after the death of Ayatollah Khamenei, transforming Iran from a theocracy to a military-dominated country like Pakistan or Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another scenario is that a faction of the Revolutionary Guards, fearful of American-backed regime change, could move against him first. “While a military coup was unthinkable a few years ago,” Mr. Ostovar said, “it’s becoming increasingly likely now because of all the pressures building on the regime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is further complicated by the generational divide inside the Revolutionary Guards, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the older generation came of age during the war with Iraq in the 1980s, a time of deprivation and hardship, younger officers rose through the ranks at a time of Iranian expansion, as its influence spread through Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dismayed by the loss of that foreign network over the past few years, as well as by the severe damage to Iran’s nuclear program caused by the 12-day war in June, a more aggressive and assertive faction has emerged among younger members of the Revolutionary Guards, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while an older group of Revolutionary Guards has gotten rich — with children in elite private schools, homes in foreign countries and luxury cars — the younger generation has yet to taste much of that wealth, and wants to protect what it sees as its rightful reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They know that if the regime goes, they will lose their meal ticket — and be first in line for retribution,” Mr. Ostovar said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Iran goes from here is hard to know, but its future path has drawn comparisons with countries like North Korea, Turkey, Egypt and Russia. Still, predictions are fraught: In recent weeks, the internet has been restricted and a curtain of fear has fallen over the country, making information especially scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran’s government has survived at least four earlier waves of protest, many of which also stirred speculation of regime change, while the ayatollah has defied rumors that he was dying of cancer or was in poor health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most analysts agree that, this time, the pressure on Ayatollah Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards is likely to only increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is not a sustainable situation where you wait for an elderly leader to die to put things back in order,” said Mr. Vaez, drawing comparisons with the last years of Mao Zedong in China, or Leonid I. Brezhnev in the Soviet Union. In Iran, “the problem is the country doesn’t have the time to wait him out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-ukraine-talks-lmgj/24int-ukraine-talks-lmgj-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rare three-way talks among Russian, Ukrainian and American officials entered their second day on Saturday in the United Arab Emirates, as President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that he expected “at least some answers” from Russia on the current draft of a plan to end the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peace plan originated last fall as a proposal negotiated between the Trump administration and Russia, but it has since been revised several times, with input from Ukraine, the United States, European nations and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zelensky argued in recent days that it was time for Russia to provide answers on the peace plan as it now stands, even as Moscow has shown little appetite to stop its attacks on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peace plan’s 20 points cover security, postwar reconstruction, exchanges of prisoners and other matters tied to the conflict, which started nearly four years ago with Russia’s full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking late Friday after the first day of talks, Mr. Zelensky said in a video address to Ukrainians that he was regularly in touch with the country’s negotiators in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, and that they “should already have at least some answers” on Moscow’s position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Zelensky said it was “still too early to draw conclusions” on whether Russia would negotiate in good faith. The talks are expected to wrap up on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is necessary that not only Ukraine has the desire to end this war and achieve full security, but that a similar desire somehow emerges in Russia as well,” Mr. Zelensky said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite some progress in recent months of peace negotiations, Ukraine and Russia are still at odds over key sticking points tied to security and territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, Ukraine fleshed out proposals for postwar security guarantees with both the United States and Europe, with some European countries vowing that they would commit troops to dissuade Russia from invading again. But Moscow has rejected any deployment of troops from NATO member states on Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Ukrainian authorities have refused Russia’s request to control all of the Donetsk region, a former industrial and coal-mining powerhouse in eastern Ukraine that the war has left mostly in ruins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators have discussed what Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s envoy for peace talks, has called various “iterations” of compromises. Suggestions have included putting neutral forces as peacekeepers in part of the Donetsk region or forming a demilitarized zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Russia has rejected any settlement on territory that departs from what Russian officials have characterized as an agreement reached between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin at a summit in Alaska last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After those talks, neither leader publicly laid out a detailed plan for dividing Ukrainian territory, although Mr. Trump told European leaders at the time that he supported a plan to end the war by ceding unconquered territory to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Mr. Zelensky said the talks in the United Arab Emirates would focus on control of territory in eastern Ukraine. Any compromise for Ukraine would be bitter after more than a decade of bloodshed defending the region, beginning with a first Russian military incursion in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zelensky told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday that “we are at the moment, if all the sides will work a lot, we will end this war.” But he also suggested that Russia might “play games” that would derail talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-syria-kurds-hbqf/24int-syria-kurds-hbqf-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syria’s defense ministry said on Saturday that it would extend a cease-fire across all military operations for 15 days, hours after a weeklong truce with a Kurdish-led militia in the country’s northeast expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry said in a statement on social media that the extension was in support of an operation led by the United States to transfer detainees from the Islamic State group held in Syria to Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syrian government troops have in recent weeks taken control of large areas of territory held by Kurds in eastern and northern Syria, including strategic assets like oil fields and dams, after intense clashes with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Syrian armed forces took over parts of the northeast, the United States began relocating detainees from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, amid concerns that thousands of former fighters and their relatives could break out of detention in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense ministry’s statement on Saturday made no explicit reference to the government’s conflict with the S.D.F., though the group said in a subsequent post on social media that an agreement had been reached through international mediation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Syrian government and the Kurds agreed last Sunday to an immediate cease-fire that called for the full integration of Kurdish troops into the national army, a longstanding demand of the Syrian government, as well as the handing over of administrative control of much of the northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Syrian state news agency SANA reported on Tuesday that the government had given the S.D.F. four days to submit a detailed plan for the integration of Hasakah Province, which was the only province left under the militia’s authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether a plan had been submitted, and a spokesman for the group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts widely saw the truce deal as a capitulation, because the S.D.F. lost almost all of the concessions the Syrian government had offered in earlier negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SANA cited an unnamed government source on Saturday night as saying that the cease-fire had ended, and that it was weighing its next steps. And Syria’s foreign ministry had dismissed reports circulating on social media that the deadline would be extended, SANA said, citing a ministry official, Mohammad Taha al-Ahmad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All options remain on the table, alongside calm and dialogue, to enforce the law, preserve Syria’s unity and safeguard the rights of the Syrian people,” Mr. al-Ahmad said, according to SANA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S.D.F. had accused the government on social media of deploying troops in breach of the cease-fire, saying it was an effort to “undermine de-escalation and steer the situation toward war instead of political solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s recent advances have strengthened President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s grip on Syria, more than a year after his rebel forces overthrew the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad, whose family had ruled the country for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. al-Sharaa has sought to bring Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious communities under centralized rule with himself at the helm in the capital, Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has also pledged that all of Syria’s minority communities will be protected under his government and, this month, signed a decree affirming Kurdish rights, including calls to restore Syrian citizenship to Kurds stripped of it after a 1962 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S.D.F., which has long positioned itself as the defender of Syrian Kurds and administered a de facto state in northeastern Syria, has posed the most formidable challenge to Mr. al-Sharaa’s effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kurdish-led militia has resisted full integration into the government’s army, seeking autonomy over its territories and security in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet those Kurdish forces have also long been key partners of the United States, assisting in the fight against the Islamic State guarding American bases and managing detention camps and prisons that housed thousands of jihadists and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership appeared to come undone this week, after the U.S. special envoy to Syria, Thomas J. Barrack, said that Washington no longer viewed Kurdish-led forces as its main partner in the fight against the Islamic State. Mr. Barrack said he believed that the Syrian government was now ready to take on those responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That apparent policy shift reflected Washington’s increasing confidence in Mr. al-Sharaa, who maintains a close relationship with President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the Kurdish militia fighters, “There’s a profound sense of abandonment and fear, layered with exhaustion,” said Nanar Hawach, a senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, which focuses on conflict prevention. “For them, individual integration into the Syrian army isn’t a bureaucratic detail. It is the end of the project they have fought for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cease-fire remained fragile and, this week, fighting broke out around two prisons in northeast Syria that housed ISIS members, highlighting the vulnerability of the agreement and raising fears that some may escape during the handover process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for American military operations in the Middle East, said that U.S. forces had already relocated 150 Islamic State fighters from a detention center in northeastern Syria to an undisclosed “secure location” in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military added that as many as 7,000 ISIS detainees currently held in Syria could eventually be transferred to facilities managed by Iraqi authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the cease-fire, the S.D.F. agreed to transfer control of the northern province of Raqqa and the eastern province of Deir al-Zour to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the cease-fire was extended, the United Nations warned of a looming humanitarian crisis in some Kurdish-held cities in Syria, citing disruptions to electricity and water amid bitter winter conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary general, said on Friday that all roads into Kobani, a Kurdish stronghold in northern Syria, were closed, and that disruptions to electricity, water and internet were limiting access to basic services. Food and essential supplies are at risk of shortages, he said, and while health facilities remain open, medicine remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.N. was working with its partners and local authorities to conduct additional assessments and secure access, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, even as Mr. al-Sharaa makes territorial gains, he faces a crucial test, Mr. Hawach said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Al-Sharaa has an opportunity here,” he said. “If he can now demonstrate that integration means genuine inclusion, it would be the strongest signal yet that Syria’s new order is different from what came before.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-canada-trump-tkcv/24int-canada-trump-tkcv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump on Saturday threatened Canada with steep tariffs if it “makes a deal with China” and insulted Prime Minister Mark Carney, his latest swing at the country since Mr. Carney pushed back against his policies in a highly publicized speech in Davos, Switzerland, this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,” Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social. He referred to Mr. Carney as “Governor Carney,” a reference to Mr. Trump’s repeated insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no indication that Canada and China are in discussions about a broad trade agreement. Mr. Trump may have been reacting to Mr. Carney’s state visit to China last week, during which he agreed to lower tariffs on some Chinese electric vehicles in exchange for China doing the same for some Canadian agricultural products. The closely watched visit was billed as a crucial reset in the two countries’ relationship, but the trade agreement itself was modest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada gave Jamieson Greer, the U.S. Trade Representative, a detailed preview of the agreement with China before it was signed, a senior Canadian official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to divulge details about communication between the two administrations. Mr. Trump appeared to praise Mr. Carney after the deal was announced. (“Good for him,” he said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he soured on the prime minister after Mr. Carney’s Davos speech, in which Mr. Carney declared that the U.S.-led world order had been ruptured and called on “middle powers” like Canada to band together to survive a new and perilous era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without mentioning Mr. Trump or the United States by name, Mr. Carney pointedly called out the use of tariffs as coercion. “More recently, great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,” Mr. Carney said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speech did not go down well with Mr. Trump, who responded in his own address the next day at Davos, saying that Canada “lives because of the United States.” Mr. Trump also rescinded an invitation to Mr. Carney to join his “Board of Peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Carney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Trump’s post on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mr. Trump routinely fails to make good on his tariff threats, calling Mr. Carney “governor” could be a bad sign for the two countries’ relationship. After returning to the White House last year, Mr. Trump routinely applied the title to Mr. Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, as part of his rhetoric about the United States annexing Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our economics reporters — based in New York, London, Brussels, Berlin, Hong Kong and Seoul — are digging into every aspect of the tariffs causing global turmoil. They are joined by dozens of reporters writing about the effects on everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Carney had been much more respectful, at least until the Davos gathering. The leaders met several times last year, twice in the White House, and Mr. Trump expressed admiration for Mr. Carney’s electoral victory last spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, their warm words have not materialized into an improved trade relationship. Though the United States has a three-way trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has imposed tariffs on certain exports from both countries, which in Canada’s case have hurt its steel, aluminum, automobile and lumber industries. A review of the three-way trade deal is due this year, and its renewal is far from certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has maintained that the United States does not need anything from Canada, even as it gets most of its imported oil from its northern neighbor and their economies continue to be closely integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest flashpoint bodes ill for Canada’s efforts to stabilize its relationship with the Trump administration, just as Mr. Carney looks for new allies and trading partners to lessen his country’s overwhelming dependence on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Mr. Carney is a former governor of the central banks of both Canada and Britain, he is new to elected office, and he has staked his leadership of Canada on a strategy of diversifying from the United States and streamlining trade within Canada itself. He has also committed billions to making Canada less dependent on the United States for its defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his Davos speech, Mr. Carney indicated that he had given up hopes of a return to the way things had been before Mr. Trump’s second term. “The old order is not coming back. We should not mourn it,” he said. “Nostalgia is not a strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
