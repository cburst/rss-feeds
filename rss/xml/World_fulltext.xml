A high-speed train smashed into another train after derailing in the southern province of Córdoba, officials said. The cause of the accident was not immediately clear.

&lt;p&gt;A high-speed train ran off its track and crashed into another high-speed train late Sunday in southern Spain, killing at least 21 people and injuring dozens of others, according to the local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accident is the deadliest train accident in Spainsince 2013, when 80 people died after a train veered off a curved section of track in the country’s northwest. The country has the second-longest high-speed rail network in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collision on Sunday occurred at 7:45 p.m. in Adamuz, in the southern province of Córdoba. The train that derailed first was a privately-operated one that was traveling to Madrid from Málaga, on the country’s southern coast. The rear cars of that train fell into the opposite track, where it collided with an incoming train operated by Spain’s national rail company, which was bound for the southern city of Huelva, west of Seville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iryo, the operator of the first train, said that around 300 passengers were on board at the time of the crash. Renfe, the operator of the second train, has not said how many passengers it was carrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain’s state-owned rail infrastructure agency said in a statement that rail traffic between Madrid and several major cities in southern Andalucía — including Córdoba, Seville, Málaga and Huelva — will be suspended on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergency response crews continued to search through the wreckage of the crash early Monday, with officials warning that the death toll may rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the 2013 disaster, the derailment on Sunday happened on a straight portion of the track. An independent commission has been launched to investigate what caused it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Óscar Puente, Spain’s transport minister, told reporters that the first train to derail was only a few years old and that the section of the track where the accident occurred had been recently renovated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The accident is extremely strange,” he said. “It happened on a straightaway. All the experts we have consulted are extremely baffled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: “If there had not been an oncoming train, we would not be talking about casualties of any type.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain expressed sympathy for the victims’ families on social media, saying that “the entire country stands with them in this extremely difficult moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tonight is a night of deep pain for our country,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Andalucía government has set up a medical post at the crash site for victims, while the Córdoba city government has issued an urgent appeal for doctors to help treat the injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paco Carmona, the director of Córdoba’s fire brigade, told public television that emergency crews were prioritizing assistance for victims still trapped in the two carriages most severely damaged in the crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19int-gaza-board-explain-photo-zhkp/19int-gaza-board-explain-photo-zhkp-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When President Trump said he planned to establish and lead a “Board of Peace” to oversee the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, many did not know what to make of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, letters went out asking countries to join the newly minted body, among them historically close U.S. allies like Canada, France, Britain, and Saudi Arabia. But Russia and Belarus, hardly allies, were also on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a perusal of the body’s charter — which governments received alongside their invitations — suggested that Mr. Trump hopes the Board of Peace could get involved in all kinds of global conflicts, not just the one in the Gaza Strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics reacted furiously, saying the Trump administration appeared to be setting up the board as a potential American-dominated rival to the United Nations, which Mr. Trump has long accused of liberal bias and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As chairman, Mr. Trump would have considerable influence over the Board of Peace. With countries being asked to pay more than $1 billion for permanent membership, its budget could be substantial, though it is unclear how much control Mr. Trump would have over how the money is spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of Turkey and Qatar on one of the board’s subcommittees also prompted an immediate outcry from Israel, which has been at odds with the Turkish government, particularly over the war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we know so far about the Board of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the board appeared to be part of Mr. Trump’s vision for postwar Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His plan called the board a “new international transitional body” that would help supervise the rebuilding of the Palestinian enclave. The board’s members would include world leaders, with Mr. Trump sitting at the head of the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Security Council later formally backed the board in a U.S.-drafted resolution in November, giving it the force of international legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution gave the board a mandate to work with governments to recruit international peacekeepers for Gaza. It was to carry out Mr. Trump’s plan in Gaza until the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority conducted reforms, the resolution said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after the United States circulated the board’s charter on Friday, it became clear that Mr. Trump envisions a much bigger role for the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed charter said the Board of Peace would “secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” not just Gaza, according to a copy shared with The New York Times. It also called for “a more nimble and effective international peace-building body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of invitees includes Britain, Jordan, Russia and more. But so far, only a handful — like the pro-Trump Argentine president, Javier Milei, and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary — have said they will join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite overseeing Gaza, neither the Board of Peace nor a Gaza Executive Board underneath it have any Palestinian members as yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board is, however, to oversee the work of a group of Palestinian technocrats charged with administering public services in Gaza. Analysts say they will face a formidable challenge, given that Gaza is still split in two between areas under Israeli and Hamas control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some countries appear skeptical. To acquire a permanent seat on the Board of Peace, each would have to pay more than a billion dollars in cash within the first year to fund the body’s operations. (States can join for three years for free.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charter would invest considerable personal power in Mr. Trump as chairman. It says that he will name members of a second “Executive Board” to carry out the board’s decisions, and that Mr. Trump would wield considerable veto power over its actions. He would also be able to name his own successor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump would also be permitted to enact “resolutions or other directives” to carry out the board’s mission, and to “create, modify or dissolve subsidiary entities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France does not currently intend to join, as the board’s charter raises serious questions about respecting the role of the United Nations, said a senior French official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comply with government protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how many countries will pay the fee to become permanent members, as opposed to accepting the optional three-year term for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not exactly clear how much oversight the Board of Peace will exert over Gaza and for how long. But two subcommittees reporting to Mr. Trump’s board have already been set up to carry out his Gaza peace plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the White House named a “Gaza Executive Board” that includes Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s envoy. The group also has Qatari and Egyptian officials, as well as an Israeli businessman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a rare public break with Mr. Trump, Israel criticized the makeup of the committee, particularly the presence of Qatar and Turkey. Both countries helped mediate between Israel and Hamas to secure the Gaza cease-fire, but Israeli officials have accused them of being too close to Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ségolène Le Stradic contributed reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/24/world/19int-venezuela-hezbollah/19int-venezuela-hezbollah-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After American forces seized Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Secretary of State Marco Rubio cast the Latin American country as a regional platform for Iranian influence, and accused the government of hosting Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rubio told CBS that among the reasons for capturing Mr. Maduro on Jan. 2, the U.S. wanted to ensure that Venezuelan leaders “no longer cozy up to Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.” He pressed Venezuela’s new leader, Delcy Rodríguez, to sever ties with both Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if she does, it may not have great impact on an already weakened Hezbollah. The group, which had been the dominant political and militant power in Lebanon for decades, was battered by a war with Israel and faces mounting pressure from the U.S., Israeli and Lebanese governments to give up its weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American authorities have long accused Hezbollah of complicity in drug trafficking and money laundering schemes in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah’s connection stemmed from the relationship between Venezuela and Iran. Two oil-rich countries under American sanctions, they were bound by anti-American ideology and helped each other evade U.S. sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran and Venezuela have maintained economic and political ties since before Iran’s 1979 revolution, which brought an authoritarian clerical regime to power. Both were founding members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the revolution, Venezuela was one of the first to recognize Iran’s new regime. The relationship deepened after Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, became president in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following decades, Iran invested billions in Venezuela’s oil and energy sector, along with other housing and industrial projects that often had little to no financial return, but gave Iran a foothold in America’s backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That opened the door for Hezbollah to make inroads in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American authorities have long accused Hezbollah of using Venezuela as a base for drug trafficking and money laundering in collusion with Venezuelan officials. But experts say those illicit schemes do not seem critical to Hezbollah’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most evidence of the illicit revenue streams stems from a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration initiative launched in 2008 to disrupt Hezbollah’s financing networks. That investigation found that Hezbollah was involved in trafficking cocaine from Colombia through Venezuela and colluding with Venezuelan officials to move cash, contraband and Hezbollah personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the investigation’s most prominent resulting criminal indictments involved Ayman Saied Joumaa, who holds dual Lebanese and Colombian citizenship. A federal grand jury indicted him for running one of the region’s most sophisticated international drug smuggling and money laundering networks. Mr. Joumaa, who was never arrested, has not publicly commented on the charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah made millions through Mr. Joumaa’s network, according to American authorities. The network paid Hezbollah operatives to help move its narcotics and illicit funds through Beirut’s international airport, among other routes, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American authorities accused Venezuelan officials of facilitating Hezbollah operations in the country. They accused the Venezuelan state airline of operating flights between Caracas, Damascus and Tehran that carried Hezbollah members and weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The D.E.A. also said it found evidence of Venezuelan politicians issuing passports to Hezbollah fighters and coordinating cocaine and weapons trafficking between Mr. Maduro’s government and Hezbollah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah and Venezuelan officials have denied these allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As for us in Hezbollah, we have no organizational, financial, security, military, or any other kind of presence in Venezuela,” Hassan Fadlallah, a Hezbollah member of Lebanese parliament, said this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah experts remain skeptical that Mr. Maduro’s capture will greatly affect Hezbollah’s operations. Analysts say the relationship between Hezbollah and Mr. Maduro’s government, though rooted in shared anti-American sentiments, had little practical value for Hezbollah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The relationship between Venezuela and Hezbollah is primarily a symbolic one,” said Kassem Kassir, a Lebanese political analyst and expert on Hezbollah who is close to the group. “Practically, nothing has changed with Hezbollah after the fall of Maduro.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many also question how important the illicit revenue streams outlined by American authorities actually are for the militant group’s operations in Lebanon today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you look at the different pieces of these links, you see very thin evidence of Hezbollah’s having widespread involvement” in illicit schemes in Venezuela, said Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. “We haven’t seen enough evidence that the organization is relying heavily on drug trafficking, like the Taliban did in Afghanistan, in funding its operations,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah’s External Security Organization, an arm of the group focusing on operations outside Lebanon, appeared the most heavily involved in Venezuela, Mr. Hage said. But that wing is much smaller and less active than it was at its peak in the early 2000s — lessening the blow from the upheaval in Venezuela today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of Hezbollah’s financing comes from Iran, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for Hezbollah, the much more immediate concern is the effect that the weakening of the Iranian state, and the current unrest in Iran, will have on its ability to fund its Lebanese proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-December, as negotiations to end Russia’s war in Ukraine gathered pace, a group of Ukrainian officials sat in a conference room in New York for a meeting with senior executives at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had come to discuss a crucial element of a peace plan drafted by Kyiv and Washington: Ukraine’s postwar recovery. BlackRock had been enlisted to help build a strategy for what President Volodymyr Zelensky has called an $800 billion “prosperity plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting, held at BlackRock’s headquarters, kick-started work on identifying funding sources and investment priorities, according to three officials familiar with the conversation, who requested anonymity to discuss a closed-door meeting. More details are expected to be unveiled this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in Kyiv and other European capitals, BlackRock’s role has generated more questions than answers, as the Trump administration steers plans for rebuilding Ukraine toward American business interests. Seven European and Ukrainian officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive talks, voiced doubts about BlackRock’s ability to attract the enormous investments envisioned. Some indicated that the firm’s involvement could turn away potential investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the officials noted that BlackRock had already tried, and failed, in the war’s early years to raise billions to rebuild Ukraine. Confidential slide presentations viewed by The New York Times indicate that BlackRock had trouble attracting investors at that time. A slide from April 2023 projected that the firm would help mobilize $50 billion to $80 billion. A year later, another slide slashed the target to $15 billion to $30 billion. The project was shelved in mid-2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock struggled in part because of concerns in Europe that money from its governments could end up in a privately run American fund, according to the European and Ukrainian officials. Europe is expected to fund the vast majority of Ukraine’s recovery. With BlackRock now back at the table, the European worries are likely to resurface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the firm has played a pro bono, advisory role in the new talks. It is unclear whether that mandate will expand as negotiations progress, or if peace is reached. A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment for this article. The White House and the Ukrainian economy ministry did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The involvement in the talks of a private firm whose main business is to maximize financial returns has reinforced concerns that the Trump administration views Ukraine’s reconstruction as a profit-making opportunity for the U.S. government and American companies, rather than as primarily a humanitarian or security matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, President Trump pushed for a deal granting the United States a stake in Ukraine’s mineral wealth. In peace talks with Kyiv, the president’s main negotiators have been real estate developers: his billionaire friend Steve Witkoff, and Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. BlackRock’s chief, Larry Fink, has sat next to Mr. Kushner in talks with Ukrainian leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current draft peace plan lays out an array of U.S. investment opportunities and calls for a free-trade agreement. “There’s a lot of wealth to be had,” Mr. Trump said about Ukraine’s future during negotiations with Mr. Zelensky last month in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian officials have likened their country’s recovery blueprint to the Marshall Plan, the U.S.-funded project to rebuild Europe after World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That effort, which cost about $150 billion in today’s money, would be dwarfed by the $800 billion “prosperity plan” described by Mr. Zelensky. The enormous sum has led some Ukrainian economists and business figures to view the U.S. proposal with deep skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington might try to tap some of the roughly $250 billion in Russian assets frozen in Europe — an idea that was included in a draft Russian-U.S. peace plan. But two of the European officials said there would be fierce opposition to handing control of the assets to a U.S.-led recovery fund. There are also fears among European officials that BlackRock’s involvement signals that the Trump administration intends to sideline Europe in postwar planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Marshall Plan was led by the U.S. government. The possibility that Ukraine’s recovery could be shaped by BlackRock, a private firm, has raised concerns about transparency and potential conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock’s involvement in Ukraine dates to the fall of 2022, when Kyiv began to imagine a postwar future after pushing Russian troops from large areas of territory. That September, Andrew Forrest, an Australian mining magnate, introduced Mr. Zelensky to BlackRock’s chief executive, Mr. Fink. They discussed how the firm could advise Kyiv on setting up a reconstruction fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding formalizing the collaboration. Under the agreement, which was seen by The Times, BlackRock’s consulting arm would help design the fund’s structure and governance, and pitch it to potential investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund’s central idea was to draw money from governments and financial institutions, and leverage it to attract several times as much in private lending capital, said Oleksandr Gryban, a former deputy economy minister for Ukraine who worked on the fund. Public money would serve as seed capital, absorbing the first losses and acting as a de-risking mechanism to entice private investors wary of putting money into Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slide presentations from 2023 and 2024 show that BlackRock aimed to raise money from European development banks, including KfW of Germany and Proparco of France. None of the documents indicate that BlackRock planned to invest its own money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the firm approached European countries, it encountered strong reluctance, according to European and Ukrainian officials. The Europeans cautioned that BlackRock lacked experience in Ukraine. Although the slide presentations did not name a fund manager, the officials said they had expected BlackRock to take that role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When BlackRock halted its search for investors last year, European officials stepped in. They started their own reconstruction fund for Ukraine, with a more modest target of raising 1 billion euros, about $1.15 billion, this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months later, however, BlackRock was back in the picture. On Dec. 10, Mr. Fink sat with American negotiators as they joined an online meeting with Mr. Zelensky and senior Ukrainian officials. “This was the first meeting of the group that will work on a document regarding the reconstruction and economic recovery of Ukraine,” Mr. Zelensky said afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock’s role, he later explained, will be to “organize the implementation of the strategic recovery plan.” He said the plan envisioned multiple funds covering different areas like reconstruction, economic development and human capital. Ukrainian officials say governments and financial institutions would fund needed but noncommercial sectors, such as education, while private investors would focus on commercial activities that could offer higher returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach echoes BlackRock’s original proposals. The firm’s slide presentations outlined several sector-specific funds to finance projects using a mix of public and private money. Energy, infrastructure, agriculture, manufacturing and information technology were listed as priority sectors. A slide from April 2024 identified nine potential investment projects, including the development of wind farms and lithium deposits, totaling $1.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether BlackRock or the Trump administration has approached U.S. investors about participating in the recovery plan. But Mr. Zelensky suggested last month that the plan would favor American business interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock itself could stand to profit from the recovery as the owner of Global Infrastructure Partners, one of the world’s largest financiers of projects to build airports, bridges and tunnels. Last year, Global Infrastructure Partners stepped in to assist the Trump administration by purchasing two ports in Panama from a Hong Kong company that had become the focus of tensions between Panama and Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Zelensky presented the U.S.-Ukraine draft peace plan to reporters last month, he said that a “Ukraine Development Fund” — the same name used in BlackRock’s original fund project — would be established “to invest in high-growth sectors, including technology, data centers and artificial intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are sectors that the White House has prioritized more broadly for investment, pushing for deals that have financially benefited members of the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect of a recovery plan tilted toward high-growth sectors has drawn criticism. Meaghan Mobbs, who runs a charity in Ukraine and is the daughter of Keith Kellogg, Mr. Trump’s former envoy to Ukraine, wrote on social media that BlackRock’s involvement risked prioritizing “profitable sectors over public needs” and weakening oversight of recovery funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oleksii Sobolev, Ukraine’s economy minister, said this month that some $500 billion would need to come from public sources, in the form of grants and low-interest loans from public banks. But several Ukrainian business figures and officials expressed doubt that governments and financial institutions could raise such a sum, which exceeds in value all the military, financial and humanitarian aid that Ukraine has received since the war began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has left many Ukrainian business figures to see Kyiv’s talk of an $800 billion recovery plan mostly as political messaging calibrated for a business-first Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to say it to please Trump,” said Sergey Fursa, deputy director of the Kyiv-based investment firm Dragon Capital. “But right now, we simply don’t see where that kind of money would come from. This is wishful thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19syria-prisons-01-zpqj/19syria-prisons-01-zpqj-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clashes erupted on Monday around two prisons in northeastern Syria holding members of the terrorist group Islamic State, a day after a Kurdish-led militia agreed to hand over control over the prisons to the Syrian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That agreement between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., and the central government ended weeks of deadly clashes between the two sides. The S.D.F. agreed to merge into the national military and hand over control of security infrastructure — including prisons housing about 8,000 Islamic State detainees — to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the clashes around two of those prisons underscored the fragility of that deal. Within hours, both the government and the S.D.F. accused each other of trying to derail the agreement. The government accused the S.D.F. of releasing Islamic State detainees from al-Shaddadi prison in Hasakah Province and of exploiting the security threat posed by those detainees for political gains, according to state media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement was a significant victory for the government and a stunning setback for the S.D.F., which lost control over territory, oil resources and other strategic assets just in the past few days. The S.D.F. emerged with few cards to play in future negotiations over any power its leaders and its forces may retain as part of the new government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violence also revived fears around whether the new government would be able to maintain the same level of security the S.D.F. had in an area that once served as the heartland of the Islamic State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Monday evening, Syrian officials said they had taken control of al-Shaddadi prison and were combing the area in an effort to rearrest an unspecified number of prisoners they said had been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S.D.F., in turn, accused armed groups “affiliated” with those in power in Damascus, the capital, of attacking the prison early Monday morning, without identifying the attackers more specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S.D.F. officials also accused armed groups of attacking another prison, al-Aqtan, in Raqqa, which is the largest city administered by Kurdish authorities and which once served as the capital of the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate. At least nine S.D.F. fighters were killed in the clashes, the S.D.F said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clashes made it clear that the cease-fire reached on Sunday had not yet quelled the tensions between Kurdish forces and Syria’s central government over who controls the country’s northeastern region. The Islamic State seized much of that region in 2014 and ruled it for years before the S.D.F., with U.S. backing, reclaimed the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government institutions in the northeastern province, a semiautonomous region long administered by the Kurds, will also come under the central government’s authority as will Syria’s gas and oil fields in the area, nearly all of which have been under Kurdish control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement was widely viewed as little more than a surrender by the S.D.F., which for months has been in stalled negotiations with the government over the terms of their integration into the new Syrian state that assumed control after the ouster of the dictator Bashar al-Assad in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after a lightning advance by the Syrian military into Kurdish-held territory this month, the S.D.F. forces were put on the back foot and ultimately agreed to the cease-fire deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, the central government was to assume security responsibility over prisons holding more than 8,000 Islamic State members captured during the civil war, including al-Shaddadi and al-Aqtan prisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central government is also to take over the sprawling Al Hol detention camp, which houses tens of thousands of family members of Islamic State fighters, many of them foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the clashes around the prisons broke out, the S.D.F. accused the U.S.-led coalition, which maintains a few troops on the ground, of ignoring calls for help. A senior U.S. military official denied the S.D.F. claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters, said Monday they are working to de-escalate the tense situation. The official also said a number of prisoners had been recaptured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Islamic State seized territory in northeastern Syria in 2014 and ruled there and neighboring Iraq for years, brutally enforcing its strict interpretation of Islamic law. As the S.D.F. battled to reclaim that land with U.S. support, they detained thousands of ISIS fighters and tens of thousands of their relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years since the Islamic State was routed in 2017, the land that was retaken in northeastern Syria has remained under S.D.F. control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Mr. al-Assad’s ouster, the S.D.F. entered negotiations to integrate into the new national military. The deal on Sunday was the second it had struck with the government in less than a year. Whether it holds up is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday evening, the Syrian government sought to position itself as the best ally to international partners in dealing with the threat from ISIS detainees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interior Ministry accused the S.D.F. of a “serious security violation threatening Syrian, regional, and international security,” in a statement on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Restoring legitimate state institutions and enforcing the rule of law are the only permanent guarantees of security and stability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19int-venezuela-chavista-vfgw/19int-venezuela-chavista-vfgw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nearly three decades, Venezuelans have been fed an ideology of “Chavismo,” with its goal of harnessing oil wealth to transform the country, empower the poor and stand up to the United States and its imperial ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet on Thursday, the director of the C.I.A. was in Caracas to meet with Venezuela’s interim president to discuss greater bilateral collaboration, as Washington starts to take its cut of the country’s vast oil wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since the United States invaded to snatch President Nicolás Maduro this month, Venezuelans have been struggling to come to terms with their government’s new alliance with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Maduro awaits trial in the United States, his inner circle continues to run Venezuela. It is made up of self-described Chavistas, but their ideological credentials are now being questioned by die-hard believers who remain loyal to former President Hugo Chávez’s approach of blending socialism, nationalism, state control of key industries and anti-imperialism (read: anti-Americanism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At this point, we should have cut off the oil, we shouldn’t have sold any oil to the United States. Zero oil, zero oil!” said one 63-year-old Venezuelan, Beatriz, who asked that only her first name be used as the government cracks down on dissent. “It’s the only way President Nicolás Maduro — the legitimate president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela — will return to our country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days after Mr. Maduro was seized, Beatriz took to the streets to chant anti-American slogans. The crowd of hundreds around her in downtown Caracas chanted in unison, demanding that President Trump return their former leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Devuélvenos a Nico!” they cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the combative, anti-American crowds that first came out after Mr. Maduro’s capture appear to have been tamed in the past week. The government’s new message: Get on board, we are doing business with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, gave her first State of the Union address last week, she maintained a delicate balance between anti-American rhetoric and the new reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They attacked, assaulted, killed, invaded and kidnapped President Maduro and the first lady,” Ms. Rodríguez said Thursday. “There is a stain on relations between the United States and Venezuela.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She then whipsawed, urging legislators to approve a bill to open oil fields to new investments. “Let us not be afraid of diplomacy,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Rodríguez is now offering a newer groupthink to replace the anti-Americanism her government once stoked: “Dudar es traicionar,” or “Doubt is treason.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slogan appeared last year as the specter of U.S. invasion neared. Now it is printed on hats and jackets handed out by the government and angrily whispered among Venezuelans when anyone registers outrage about the government’s alliance with Washington — the enemy they had once been told was preventing Venezuela from achieving prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mr. Maduro has long blamed the United States for the economic collapse that ripped through the country beginning in 2013, leading to children dying from hunger and hospitals running out of basic supplies, Washington’s sanctions on Venezuela’s economy did not begin until 2017 during the first Trump administration. Before then, sanctions had largely targeted Venezuelan officials and barred Washington from selling arms to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, economic mismanagement, corruption and a fall in the price of oil — which had buttressed Mr. Chávez’s socialism — led to internal discontent by the time Mr. Maduro took power in 2013, leading to the migration of nearly eight million Venezuelans. Many who fled were the most economically vulnerable citizens, the very working-class Venezuelans Mr. Chávez had vowed to empower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Venezuelans tightened their belts, Mr. Maduro’s government became a virtual kleptocracy, analysts said. The president made sure to buy the loyalty of the armed forces. Venezuela now has some 2,000 admirals and generals with all the perks and high pay that entails (the United States has several hundred to service a much larger population).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The cracks of Chavismo were already starting to form when Maduro took power, but now how do those hard-core Chavistas jibe with the events of the past few weeks?” asked Alejandro Velasco, an associate professor of history at New York University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Under Chávez the goal was not power for power’s sake, it was to deploy national resources to empower those who had been left behind,” Mr. Velasco said. “But with Maduro — who no longer had access to the wealth when oil prices collapsed — the goal became power for power itself."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that while Mr. Chávez had started to co-opt state institutions to remake them in his image, he had allowed free and fair elections during his tenure. Mr. Maduro was accused of rigging them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Chavistas want officials to be held accountable for how easily the United States was able to invade Venezuela’s airspace this month. While ordinary citizens went hungry, the government continued to buy weapons, boasting late last year that Venezuela was well protected against foreign invasion. Yet it took only about two hours to capture Mr. Maduro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many Chavistas are painfully aware that their country’s arsenal can be used against them. Fighting a superpower is one thing, squashing internal unrest another. Venezuelans have seen their armed forces do it repeatedly for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ms. Rodríguez’s government continues to work with Washington, some Chavistas suspect her allies may have been in cahoots with Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A betrayal! Whoever did it will pay for it before God and before our people,” one protester, Victor, said at another anti-American rally in Caracas this month. He, too, asked that his last name be withheld for fear of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But forefront on his mind, as for many other Venezuelans, was the fate of the oil wealth that has long held the promise of feeding and clothing their families, and lifting their economic fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a vassal state is not an option for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The United States wants to seize the wealth we have here,” Victor said. “But we are a people who truly fight for their homeland. And we do not want to be slaves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19int-pakistan-fire-01-mghv/19int-pakistan-fire-01-mghv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fire tore through a crowded mall in Karachi this past weekend, leaving at least 23 people dead and dozens missing on Monday in the latest tragedy that urban planners and shopkeepers have blamed on chronic mismanagement in Pakistan’s largest city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road outside the mall was crowded on Monday with hundreds of residents who gathered around the blackened shell of a once-thriving market. Shopkeepers stood in silence, staring at ruined livelihoods, while families pressed against police cordons, dialing unanswered phones. Nearby, other market stalls were closed in mourning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire, which burned for nearly 24 hours, began spreading around 10 p.m. on Saturday on the lower floors of Gul Plaza, one of the busiest wholesale marketplaces in downtown Karachi. It housed about 1,200 shops selling luggage, crockery, decorative items, plastic goods, toys, garments and household supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haji Sabir, a shopkeeper who said he had narrowly escaped, said the area had been bustling: “It was wedding season. The market was crowded.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rescue officials said the flames first broke out from the lower-level shops and climbed inside the building, casting an orange glow over the surrounding narrow streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time firefighters brought the blaze under control at around 10 p.m. on Sunday night, Gul Plaza had been almost completely destroyed, leaving a burned and empty shell behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 23 people were confirmed dead, according to the state-run emergency services. Dozens more were feared to be trapped in stairwells, shops and under collapsed floors. Rescue workers said the exact toll might take days to establish, as several parts of the structure remained unstable and inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials initially suspected an electrical short circuit, but said the cause had yet to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, fire engines kept spraying water on the burning building from one side, while demolition workers pulled down badly damaged parts from the other. Rescue teams trudged through dark corridors looking for any sign of survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the building, melted electrical wires hung from the ceilings. Rolling iron shutters on storefronts were still tightly closed, some twisted out of shape. Cellphones belonging to missing merchants rang under the ash and broken concrete, but no one answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside, grief hardened into anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the fire engines had arrived on time, with proper ladders, this could have been contained,” said Mujtaba Ali, whose relative was among those believed to be trapped inside. “They were calling us from inside, saying the stairways were locked. What chance did they have?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants said that some people escaped from the ground floor, but when the fire reached the upper levels, it was too late. Firefighters’ ladders could reach no higher than the fifth floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inferno brought back painful memories in a city long plagued by deadly fires. In 2012, more than 260 workers died in a garment factory after being trapped behind barred windows. In 2023, a fire at a shopping mall killed 10 people and injured 22 others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every time, officials promise change. Every time, the city quietly returns to business as usual,” said Zahid Farooq, joint director of the Urban Resource Center, a Karachi-based nonprofit organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a culture of legalizing illegal practices,” he said. “Buildings made for 500 shops are packed with more than 1,200 shops. When buildings are overcrowded, and exits are blocked, tragedy becomes unavoidable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Karachi, Pakistan’s economic hub of more than 20 million people, fire safety laws exist mostly on paper, experts say. Building inspections are rare and punishments for violations are weak. Builders add extra floors without permission. Stairwells are locked to stop theft. Electrical wiring is poorly repaired and heavily overloaded. In crowded markets, illegal extensions clog the narrow streets so much that even small fire engines can hardly pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the weekend rescue operation, fire engines were delayed by roadside encroachments, including those unauthorized expansions, according to officials and rescue personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On social media, a short audio clip spread quickly, showing a man crying, “We’re trapped from all sides. Fire is everywhere. Please forgive me if I did something wrong.” The recording ends abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murad Ali Shah, the chief minister for Sindh Province, whose capital is Karachi, ordered an inquiry into the blaze. He directed the authorities to carry out immediate fire safety audits of commercial buildings across the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the human toll, the economic losses are expected to be severe. The Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the city’s leading mercantile body, said more than 1,000 small and medium shops had been destroyed, wiping out years of savings and cutting off the only source of income for hundreds of families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the crowd outside Gul Plaza was Sharif Khan, 42, who had opened a crockery shop just a year earlier, using a bank loan of about $7,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I put everything I had into that shop,” Mr. Khan said, his eyes fixed on the blackened ruins. “The goods are gone, the shop is gone, but the debt remains. I have no hope that the government will help us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19int-europe-alliance01-photo-jbtp/19int-europe-alliance01-photo-jbtp-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens to an 80-year-old diplomatic alliance when its leading power threatens a military invasion of one member, wages economic war on the others and vows to cultivate political and cultural resistance to their governments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the alliance doomed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question is being asked in capitals across Europe as leaders rush to respond to President Trump’s rapidly escalating campaign to acquire Greenland over the objections of the people who live there. At issue most urgently is whether resisting Mr. Trump’s territorial ambitions risks damaging Europe’s relationship with the United States beyond repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some leaders — like President Emmanuel Macron of France and Lars Klingbeil, Germany’s finance minister — appear willing to take that risk, urging Europe’s nations to consider deploying an economic “bazooka” in response to Mr. Trump’s latest tariff threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders from across Europe are expected to gather in Brussels this week to present a united response to Mr. Trump’s provocations. Veteran observers of European politics said the alliance between Europe and the United States that formed in the aftermath of World War II had already been fundamentally altered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no longer an alliance designed primarily to advance the interests of like-minded democracies, they said. Instead, it is a relationship on Mr. Trump’s terms alone — one in which he wields the leverage that comes from American power to force Europeans to cater to his whims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To use what is essentially economic warfare with allies is unprecedented in this way,” said Ian Lesser, who leads the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund, a research group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appears to be a consensus in much of Europe that it needs to build new economic and military capacities to make it less dependent on the United States. But that will take years, if not decades. In the meantime, Europe’s businesses and financial markets will still be intertwined with the buying power of consumers in the United States, and Ukraine will still need American weapons to defend itself against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, months of diplomatic effort to negotiate a cease-fire in the Ukraine war have only underscored that NATO, which was formed to defend Europe, is unable to fend off Russian aggression without security guarantees by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”It would be foolish at a time of war in Europe to jettison all of the sort of strategic and operational benefits that come with the alliance,” Mr. Lesser said. “But if the United States is no longer a reliable partner in that alliance, then Europe needs to do something else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That effort is already underway, slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day that Mr. Trump announced his latest tariff threat on social media, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, and António Costa, the president of the European Council, were in Paraguay to sign a major trade deal with a bloc of Latin American countries, one that was 25 years in the making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has so far been happy to welcome European money to purchase American-made arms for Ukraine and other countries in Eastern Europe. And he relishes surprising his so-called allies, as he demonstrated on Saturday when he announced tariffs on a group of European nations, including Britain, unless Greenland is sold to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our economics reporters — based in New York, London, Brussels, Berlin, Hong Kong and Seoul — are digging into every aspect of the tariffs causing global turmoil. They are joined by dozens of reporters writing about the effects on everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That raises the stakes for the decisions that Europe is grappling with in the days ahead. It must choose how aggressively to confront Mr. Trump without knowing what the always-unpredictable president will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is he serious? What does Europe do now? How does the U.S. respond?” Mr. Lesser said. “There will be those who say, ‘OK, how do we get through this? Is it possible to simply to engage in a kind of negotiation or investment or whatever it may be, that will defer anything radical?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has already made it clear that he views America’s European allies with disdain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his annual National Security Strategy, released last month, officials from Mr. Trump’s administration questioned whether some European countries would remain “reliable allies” in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document conceded that Europe was “strategically and culturally vital” to the United States. But it said the continent faced the “stark prospect of civilizational erasure” unless the United States helped like-minded “patriotic European parties” — a phrase that was widely understood to mean the far right — to win power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Europeans on the receiving end of those assertions, the president’s threats about acquiring Greenland “the easy way” or “the hard way” have further eroded the trust that was central to their alliance with the United States for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Going back to the level of trust that we saw beforehand would require, I think, generational change,” said Rosa Balfour, the director of Carnegie Europe, a political think tank. “The attack on Europe is not just coming from an individual, you know — it’s been turned into an ideology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the latest Greenland threats, more voices have begun urging assertive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement over the weekend, Mr. Macron vowed that “no intimidation or threat will influence us — neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called Mr. Trump’s tariff threats “unacceptable” and vowed: “Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, like Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, have argued for a diplomatic solution and cautioned against grandstanding. “That’s an understandable instinct, but it’s not effective,” the prime minister told reporters on Monday morning. “It never has been. It may make politicians feel good, but it does nothing for working people whose jobs, livelihoods and security rely on the relationships that we build across the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Ms. Balfour said that more leaders were beginning to realize that capitulating to Mr. Trump’s demands was not always in Europe’s interests. In fact, it often leads Mr. Trump to demand more concessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If true, that could have implications for the alliance with the United States and whether it survives in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reality, I think, is sinking into the mind-sets of those people who have been advocating caution, dialogue and ‘Let’s listen to what Trump has to say,’” Ms. Balfour said. “You can feel that kind of change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump is now claiming that one reason he is pushing to acquire Greenland is that he didn’t win the Nobel Peace Prize, according to a text message he sent to Norway’s prime minister over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonas Gahr Store, Norway’s leader, received the text message on Sunday, an official in the prime minister’s office said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Mr. Trump wrote in the message, which was first published by PBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump also questioned Denmark’s claim to Greenland, saying, “There are no written documents,” and adding, “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tensions over Greenland have sharply escalated in the last week, and the message injected a new level of uncertainty into Mr. Trump’s thinking and his campaign to gain control of the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland has been part of the Danish Kingdom for more than 300 years, and world leaders have condemned Mr. Trump’s insistence that the United States take over the territory, a giant icebound island in the Arctic region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to copies of the messages provided by the Norwegian prime minister’s office, Mr. Trump’s message was a response to one that Mr. Store sent Mr. Trump on Sunday. It was co-signed by the president of Finland, Alexander Stubb, a leader with whom Mr. Trump is close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European leaders asked to speak to Mr. Trump about Greenland and his threat of using tariffs to pressure Denmark into selling it, which Denmark has refused to do. They asked for a phone call and struck a collaborative tone, writing, “We believe we all should work to take this down and de-escalate — so much is happening around us where we need to stand together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Mr. Trump’s response, Mr. Store said in a statement, “As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have on several occasions clearly explained to Trump what is well known, namely that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, that awards the prize,” Mr. Store said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has repeatedly challenged Denmark’s claims to Greenland, but in decades-old agreements that the United States has signed with Denmark, the United States has recognized Denmark’s close connection to the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2004 amendment to an older defense pact between Denmark and the United States, which grants the United States broad military access, explicitly recognizes Greenland as “an equal part of the Kingdom of Denmark.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in 1916, Denmark sold what are now the U.S. Virgin Islands to the United States for $25 million in gold. In the treaty for that deal, a clause reads, “The United States of America will not object to the Danish Government extending their political and economic interests to the whole of Greenland.”In the past year, as Mr. Trump has repeatedly vowed to “get” Greenland, Denmark has repeatedly rebuffed him. Denmark’s position is that it does not have the authority to sell the self-governing territory and that Greenland’s 57,000 inhabitants will decide their own fate. Polls and interviews show that an overwhelming majority of Greenlanders strongly oppose joining the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Greenlanders staged the biggest protest of recent months. Hundreds marched through the snowy streets of Nuuk, the capital, chanting, “No means no,” “Greenland is already great” and “Yankee, go home!”In the past few days, Denmark and other European countries have sent more military forces to the island. Small groups of Danish soldiers dressed in green camouflage and dark woolen hats have been walking through downtown Nuuk. Beyond the harbor, a 200-foot-long Danish warship capable of breaking through ice has been patrolling the shoreline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much-anticipated three-way meeting last week of the United States, Denmark and Greenland, hosted by Vice President JD Vance in Washington, did not produce any breakthroughs and seemed to instead create misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time Greenland had been included in a such high-level discussions, and the Danish and Greenlandic officials left saying that a working group had been formed to explore possibilities for a solution. But the Trump administration said afterwards that the two sides would begin “technical talks on the acquisition of Greenland,” a statement that raised even more concern in Greenland, in Denmark and across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
