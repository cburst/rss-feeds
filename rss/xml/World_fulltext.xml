&lt;p&gt;The big news in the United States over the weekend was the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old American citizen in Minneapolis by federal agents. Alex Pretti was the second civilian to be killed this month during an aggressive immigration crackdown. Videos show he was restrained when he was shot. Trump administration officials have rushed to smear him as a terrorist. We have the latest coverage of the developing story below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, I spoke with A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times, about threats to press freedom from the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second time this month, federal agents shot and killed a civilian in Minneapolis, and then blocked access to the scene. Here’s the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim, a 37-year-old man named Alex Pretti, was filming on his phone and trying to help a fellow protester on Saturday morning when several agents wrestled him to the ground and restrained him. Then they shot him multiple times. You can watch what happened here. (A warning that it’s disturbing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration claimed that Pretti, a nurse at the city’s veterans hospital, had approached the federal agents with a handgun and the intent to “massacre” them. But eyewitness video footage quickly emerged indicating that Pretti never drew his concealed pistol, and had already been disarmed when he was killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His death prompted large protests across the U.S., and led to a remarkable clash: Federal authorities have blocked state and local investigators from the crime scene. A judge issued a late-night order barring federal officials from destroying evidence, as the Trump administration repeated baseless accusations against the victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretti was a U.S. citizen with no known criminal record who held a legal permit to carry a firearm. Neighbors and colleagues at the hospital described him as passionate and kindhearted. The Minneapolis chief of police, Brian O’Hara, said Pretti had appeared to be “exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity, and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More from Minneapolis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This timeline shows how the shooting unfolded in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague Charles Homans has spent the past 10 days in his native city covering what he calls “the great American unraveling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events like the shooting in Minneapolis, in which eyewitness video and independent reporting contradict the government’s account, only highlight the importance of press freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the F.B.I. searched the home of a Washington Post reporter and seized her phone, laptops and other devices. We’re used to reading about governments going after journalists in places like China, Russia or Turkey. This took place in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job of journalists is to hold the powerful to account on behalf of the public. That job is becoming harder. The economics of journalism have been tough for a couple of decades. But the most immediate threat comes from attacks on press freedom by the U.S. government and the president himself. The New York Times has been the target of multiple lawsuits from President Trump over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to the man who has been leading The Times through this new era: our publisher, A.G. Sulzberger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.G., U.S. press freedom is under attack from the Trump administration. Talk me through its playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First Amendment of the American Constitution offers the press some of the most robust protections in the world. The architects of the Constitution understood that a healthy democracy depends on an informed public, and an informed public depends on a free press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In defiance of that ideal, which has long enjoyed bipartisan support, President Trump has borrowed many of the anti-press tactics used by authoritarian-minded leaders abroad. He has spent years attacking journalists and news organizations. He has sued a number of U.S. news organizations, including The New York Times, and has extracted large financial settlements from some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His administration has aggressively used other levers of power — from access to the Pentagon to regulatory and investigative oversight — to punish news organizations for writing things they don’t like, or reward those willing to parrot administration talking points. Sadly, there is growing evidence that, in response to this pressure, certain news organizations have, at times, self-censored for fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do these attacks compare with past administrations coming after The New York Times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has been far more aggressive in working to undermine the rights and legitimacy of the press than his recent predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But every president has complaints about the people covering their administrations. Kennedy tried to get The Times to reassign our reporter in Vietnam because he was revealing how badly the war was going. Bush warned us that if we exposed his campaign of illegal wiretapping on Americans we’d have blood on our hands. Biden was so incensed with our coverage, including our reporting on questions about his age and fitness, that he became the first president in close to a century not to do a single interview with The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson from all of those examples is clear: We must continue reporting the facts and bringing what we find to the public, regardless of what pressure we might face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Times reporters already do journalism in many countries where press freedoms have been gutted or were never established. Does that help us now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world as a whole has gotten much less hospitable to independent reporting. There are a growing number of places where journalists face arrest or violence for writing pieces that challenge the government. Russia, China and Iran are the most obvious examples. Israel has killed a huge number of Palestinian journalists in Gaza and banned foreign journalists from operating freely there for more than two years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our view is that the story of those places needs to continue to be told, no matter the obstacles. So that means our reporters must work harder to find new ways to keep reporting in the face of limited access, increased surveillance and more fearful sources. And The Times must spend more on legal and security support than ever, nearly 10 times as much as a decade ago. Are those approaches for operating in more hostile environments proving useful in the United States now? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media is very unpopular. Trump is using that. What have we done badly? What could we do better to win back trust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it’s worth remembering that the vast majority of Americans still believe that a free press is important. That said, it is true that journalists will inevitably make mistakes or miss things. But our core commitment is that when we make mistakes we acknowledge them, correct them and learn from them. When we miss things, we go back to the story and dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spend an inordinate amount of time at The Times asking what we could have done differently or better. That instinct toward reflection, transparency and self-correction is to me the most important ingredient in trust. Another is bringing readers a clearer view of how our work happens and why we make certain choices — which we’re trying to do more often with reporter videos and round tables, Times Insider pieces and Q&amp;As like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re under attack, is there a danger that you become part of the polarization? That you are seen as some kind of opposition or resistance? How do you think about navigating this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not anyone’s opposition or resistance — just as we’re not anyone’s supporter or cheerleader. We’re independent. As journalists we have to focus on presenting the fullest, fairest picture of what’s happening and why it matters, and that means tuning out both jeers and cheers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of press organizations have paid Trump huge settlements in weak lawsuits. The New York Times hasn’t. Are there lessons in standing up to Trump?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has filed three lawsuits against us in my tenure, and the only check that has been sent as a result was from the president to The Times: He was ordered to repay our lawyers’ fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your rights will only hold if you exercise them. And retreating in the face of pressure just emboldens future attacks and abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-china-military-mvfl/24int-china-military-mvfl-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China’s top general, second only to Xi Jinping, the nation’s leader, in the military command, has been put under investigation and accused of “grave violations of discipline and the law,” the Ministry of National Defense said on Saturday, the most stunning escalation yet in Mr. Xi’s purge of the People’s Liberation Army elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general, Zhang Youxia, is a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, the Communist Party body that controls China’s armed forces. Another member of the commission, Gen. Liu Zhenli, who leads the military’s Joint Staff Department, is also under investigation, the Defense Ministry said. Its announcement did not say what either general was alleged to have done wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang’s downfall — few if any Chinese officials placed publicly under investigation are later declared innocent — is the most drastic step so far in Mr. Xi’s yearslong campaign to root out what he has described as corruption and disloyalty in the military’s senior ranks. It is all the more astonishing because General Zhang seemed to be a confidant of Mr. Xi, who has known him for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This move is unprecedented in the history of the Chinese military and represents the total annihilation of the high command,” Christopher K. Johnson, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst who follows Chinese elite politics, said of the investigation of General Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the two generals effectively out, the Central Military Commission has just two members left: its chairman, Mr. Xi, and General Zhang Shengmin, who has overseen Mr. Xi’s military purges. Mr. Xi has now removed all but one of the six generals he appointed to the commission in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Johnson, the president of China Strategies Group, a consulting firm, said Mr. Xi seemed to have concluded that problems in the military ran so deep that he could not trust the top command to cure itself and must look to a new cohort of rising officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appears to have “decided he must cut very deep generationally to find a group not tainted,” Mr. Johnson said. “The purging of even a childhood friend in Zhang Youxia shows there now are no limits to Xi’s anti-graft zeal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors that the general might be in trouble had spread for days, since official news reports left clues that he and General Liu had been absent from a Communist Party meeting. But General Zhang has disappeared from view before, and a senior official is usually out of sight for months before the party confirms that he is under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed with which General Zhang’s ouster was announced seemed intended to staunch the potential damage for Mr. Xi, said Su Tzu-yun, an expert on the People’s Liberation Army, or P.L.A., at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, a body funded by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This could be a big blow to morale inside the P.L.A.,” Mr. Su said in an interview, referring to the removal of a seemingly invulnerable commander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang and General Liu were also the P.L.A.’s two top commanders for practical operational tasks, and their removal will leave a gap in experience, said Shanshan Mei, a political scientist at RAND, a research organization, who studies China’s armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no one right now at the highest level who has operational experience or who is in charge of training and exercises,” Ms. Mei said. “This is going to cut very deep, and there’s more to come, possibly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang, 75, had seemed to be cordoned off from Mr. Xi’s widening purges. The two men’s fathers, both veterans of Mao Zedong’s revolutionary wars, were personally acquainted, and Mr. Xi had kept General Zhang in office beyond the customary retirement age of about 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Xi’s worries about the trustworthiness of his commanders seemed to finally outweigh whatever attachment he felt to the general, Mr. Su said. “I think this reflects Xi Jinping’s personal sense of insecurity, and that’s a major factor in his purges of the military,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2023, waves of top commanders, officers and executives for arms manufacturers have been removed from office and placed under investigation — or, in some cases, have disappeared from view without explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first purges in that wave focused on China’s Rocket Force, which operates most of its nuclear missiles and many of its conventional ones. Ensuing investigations took down admirals, regional military commanders and members of the Central Military Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the targeted officers had been promoted by Mr. Xi since he took power in 2012, vowing to cleanse the armed forces of endemic graft. But after a decade in charge, he seemed to have concluded that some of his own handpicked protégés had been infected by the military’s corruption, which historically has often involved taking bribes for contracts or promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigations’ toll on the military was visible at a meeting last year of the Communist Party’s Central Committee, a council of top officials. Of the 44 uniformed officers appointed to the committee in 2022, 29 — roughly two-thirds — had been purged or were missing, according to calculations made by Neil Thomas, a researcher on Chinese politics at the Asia Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Xi seems to have calculated that in the longer term, his shake-up of the military will make it less corrupt, more loyal and more effective in pursuing his goals, like putting pressure on Taiwan, the island democracy that rejects China’s claims of sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now, and potentially for years, the disruptions caused by the purges could leave Mr. Xi less confident that his commanders are ready for combat, analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a dilemma,” said Mr. Su, the Taiwan-based analyst. “He wants to first get rid of these so-called corrupt people, but for the P.L.A., if you clear out these high-level officers, that means a whole lot of experience is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang was among the few Chinese commanders with extensive experience in battle. The son of a general, he gained prominence as a frontline officer during China’s last war, a border conflict with Vietnam that began in 1979 and lasted for years. He rose to become head of the General Armaments Department, which is in charge of procuring weapons, and Mr. Xi promoted him to the Central Military Commission in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For Zhang Youxia, having combat experience — and being one of the only left who has any — has to add to his luster, at least to Xi Jinping,” John Culver, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst specializing in the Chinese military, said in an interview before General Zhang’s dismissal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But analysts speculated that General Zhang’s time in the General Armaments Department — which, because it controls arms contracts, became known as a honey pot of corruption — may have planted the seeds of his downfall. Other generals who rose through that department have also been purged, including Li Shangfu, a former defense minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Xi may need years or more to nurture a new crop of — presumably — trustworthy officers, and he must also fill the depleted ranks of the Central Military Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To rebuild these chains of command may take him five years or longer,” Mr. Su said. “The chances of an attack on Taiwan in the short term have been lowered.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/31/multimedia/00int-france-podcast-01-wbkq/00int-france-podcast-01-wbkq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past fall, the French podcaster Philippe Collin traveled with his millions of listeners to an enormous, almost 900-year-old castle in southwestern Germany, where members of the Nazi-backed French collaborationist government retreated after the D-Day landings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the sound of laughter and clinking champagne glasses, Mr. Collin’s listeners heard how the French collaborators celebrated Christmas in the castle’s grand mirrored gallery during the last year of World War II and planned their return to Paris on the backs of German tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a part of French history that is little known, decidedly inglorious and — to many in France — best forgotten. Yet by making podcasts about it, as part of a broader series about France’s checkered World War II history, Mr. Collin has become among the most popular podcasters in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His podcast, “Facing History,” has proved an unlikely but smashing success, passing 40 million downloads. Among historians and politicians, it has spurred reappraisals of key historical figures. And, amid fears of an expansion of Russia’s war farther into Europe and the growing popularity of the French far right, Mr. Collin hopes it will burrow into the minds of his listeners and inspire them to defend the soul of the French Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am trying to reactivate the memory of the resistance,” Mr. Collin explained over coffee recently, referring to the French underground movements that resisted the Nazis during the German occupation of much of France in 1940-45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Collin, 50, has spent his career as a producer and host of France’s most popular radio station, France Inter, where he built a reputation as an innovator and someone keen to try new things. Over the years, he has hosted shows as varied as the afternoon daily talk show and a weekly program on American culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than four years, his focus has been historical podcast series, many at least partly dedicated to France’s delicate, complicated experience of World War II, as both a victim of Nazi Germany and a collaborator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each series of “Facing History” lasts eight to 10 hours and is packed with archival radio clips, snatches of letters and memoirs read by actors, and interviews with as many as 12 historians. Despite — or perhaps because of — their uncomfortable subjects and rigorous treatment, the shows have proved popular. The series on the German castle has been downloaded more than two million times. Mr. Collin’s 2024 novel, “The Barman of the Ritz,” was so popular, its cover went back onto Paris subway walls in January to announce the paperback version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podcast has given him material for three spinoff books, three television documentaries and a nine-hour play about Léon Blum, France’s first Jewish prime minister, who was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp. Two more plays based on the series are in the works, and historians credit Mr. Collin with finding new information for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Rousso, a celebrated French historian of World War II, said that even he learned things while listening to Mr. Collin’s podcasts. “For me, he is an historian,” said Mr. Rousso, who has appeared on three of the podcasts. “He has the ability to create a historical narrative that is uniquely his own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all historians agree. Mr. Collin caused an uproar among experts on France’s war in Algeria after the podcast downplayed reports that Jean-Marie Le Pen, a far-right leader, tortured Algerians during the conflict. After the podcast, a confession by Mr. Le Pen, published posthumously, acknowledged the reports were true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Collin “dabbles in everything, and like all people who dabble in everything, he very often doesn’t really know what he’s talking about,” said Fabrice Riceputi, a historian who was motivated by the podcast to write a book documenting Mr. Le Pen’s torture of Algerians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French passion for its national history can explain some of the series’ success. But Mr. Collin thinks the country’s current mood has made it particularly receptive to these stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podcast began less than a year before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and fears of a larger war, engulfing France, have since grown. At the same time, France’s far-right party has surged. Polls show that one of its leaders would win the next presidential election in 2027, which would create the first far-right government in France since the collaborationist Vichy regime in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People have a sense the Republic is threatened again and are looking for tools to combat that,” Mr. Collin said. Adding to that sense of social anxiety, he said, are the deaths of the last remaining heroes from the war — “the guardians of the memory of the resistance,” as he calls them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are in the process of breaking away from that past,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By his own admission, Mr. Collin is “obsessed” with that past. He was trained as a historian, doing his master’s degree on the purge of suspected collaborators near the end of World War II. He would have continued had his parents had the money to keep funding his studies, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in 1975, he grew up in the tiny village of Le Fret in Brittany, the eldest of two sons of a mother who was a child care assistant and a father who worked in the navy. Like many in France, the family was haunted by the history of the war. Both of his grandfathers had been captured soldiers. Meals with the extended family were peppered with their stories, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there was the discovery of a terrible family secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His favorite great-uncle, Marcel Grob, whom he visited every summer in the Alsace region, had fought with the Waffen S.S. — the fanatical Nazi unit known for civilian massacres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he learned the truth, Mr. Collin cut his great-uncle off. He didn’t attend Mr. Grob’s funeral, he said, because he thought to himself, “I’m not going to the funeral of a Nazi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, he received Mr. Grob’s military service record and realized he had made a painful mistake. Mr. Grob, then just 17, had been a forced conscript. Through research, Mr. Collin learned that the families of conscripts who evaded their orders were sent to German labor camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All of a sudden, I said to myself, ‘What would you have done in his place?’” Mr. Collin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, he published a graphic novel, “The Journey of Marcel Grob,” as a form of apology. He spent eight years writing “Barman of the Ritz,” about a Jewish bartender during the war who served Nazis at night and found fake papers for Jewish employees by day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Collin has two stepsons with his partner, Sonia Devillers, another well-known radio journalist at France Inter. He said one of them recently asked him if he thought about the war every single day. “I said yes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his podcasts are often about much more. With his team of 10, he has examined Napoleon, the writer Molière and Louis XV’s official mistress, Jeanne de Barry. His latest series is about the Statue of Liberty, a gift to the United States from the French public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His podcast on the life of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish Army captain wrongly convicted of treason in the late 19th century, helped inspire a French lawmaker to sponsor a law that gave Mr. Dreyfus a posthumous promotion. “I listened to the entirety of Philippe Collin’s podcast,” the lawmaker, Charles Sitzenstuhl, said in an email. “It made a deep impression on me and helped me in my work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there were a drum beat to the series, it would be what Mr. Collin calls the “values of the French Republic.” By that, he means liberty, equality and fraternity — the country’s motto, born during the French Revolution in 1789 — as well as the societal systems that ensure the promise is kept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worries those values are being attacked and sees France’s current divisions as an echo of those of the 1930s, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, we are facing a form of radicalization and polarization within society, and we can clearly see the seeds of a civil war — an ideological civil war — being replanted,” he said. “We are losing our way, much like the United States, for that matter. People in the United States can no longer speak to each other.” There, he said, “the ‘other’ is no longer a human being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hopes his podcast offers listeners a kind of antidote. But, he said, he remains humble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We aren’t in politics,” he said. “We are just a podcast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/00int-denmark-leader-pfbm/00int-denmark-leader-pfbm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mette Frederiksen has never tolerated bullies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was in high school, Ms. Frederiksen, Denmark’s prime minister, stood up to a pack of skinheads for teasing immigrant kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t go so well. She got socked in the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this week, she ducked a punch, a big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After escalating threats from President Trump about seizing Greenland, Denmark’s gigantic overseas territory, Mr. Trump seems finally to have backed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a speech to the world’s financial elite in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would not use force to take Greenland. Later he said he and NATO leaders had worked out “the framework of a future deal” that would make everyone happy. That remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there were other factors to Mr. Trump’s reversal, like rising congressional opposition and falling stock markets, but there’s no doubt that Ms. Frederiksen’s carefully crafted defense helped block Mr. Trump from getting something he really wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, Ms. Frederiksen has played a nervous game of brinkmanship with Mr. Trump, and it looks like she has won — for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As negotiations continue, Ms. Frederiksen remains locked in an unwanted struggle, trying to calibrate how to make clear to the mercurial Mr. Trump that the answer to his demand that the United States have Greenland is a hard no, without antagonizing him into threatening to snatch it away again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, she has signaled her resistance to one of the compromises that Mr. Trump appeared to be considering — the establishment of American sovereignty over military bases on Greenland. Sovereignty, she insists, remains a “red line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent time with Ms. Frederiksen this fall, in Greenland, where she agreed to a rare sit-down interview in an old house overlooking the sea. We asked her if she felt Mr. Trump was acting like a bully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is able to speak in a very clear way,” she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So am I.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That quiet resolve, rather than flattery, has set her apart from other European leaders when it comes to handling Mr. Trump. It has made her extraordinarily popular at home. Opinion polls in Denmark show her party surging. Elections are later this year and the polls suggest she’s primed to win a third term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her rising support reflects just how much Greenland means for her country, let alone for Mr. Trump and Greenlanders themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Mr. Trump, the island represents the extreme of his imperial ambitions: seizing an enormous land from a NATO ally in what would be the biggest territorial acquisition in American history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 57,000 Greenlanders, a mostly Inuit population with long and complicated ties to Denmark, their future is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for Ms. Frederiksen, who swept into office in 2019 as the youngest prime minister in Danish history, the dispute is undeniably existential, threatening her country’s very identity, composition and stature on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s fast-moving developments demonstrated her tactical skills. After Mr. Trump, declared that since he didn’t win the Nobel Peace Prize he was giving up on peace and would push ahead on Greenland, she rolled up her sleeves, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She imported troops from her own coalition of the willing — including Britain, Germany, France and Iceland — to Greenland. She rallied Europe to speak out in Denmark’s defense. She resisted Mr. Trump’s threats of tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until that moment, many Danes had resigned themselves that there was little their country could do if indeed Mr. Trump moved on the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen’s risky strategy to call in foreign military and law enforcement personnel, albeit a tiny contingent of a few dozen and ostensibly part of an Arctic training exercise, was a signal that any military action that Mr. Trump took “would be very nasty and ugly,” said Bent Winther, a Danish political commentator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her point was that, “if you’re going to take Greenland by force, you’d have to put British and French and German officers in handcuffs,” Mr. Winther said. “I think that was part of the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen’s sparring with Mr. Trump has come to define her leadership. It started from her very first weeks in office in 2019, when she arrived at the age of 41 as the head of the center-left Social Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That summer, during his first term, Mr. Trump suggested that the United States buy Greenland, which has been part of Denmark for more than 300 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen dismissed it as “absurd,” which provoked Mr. Trump to cancel a trip to Copenhagen and call her remarks “nasty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does she regret saying that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a closed chapter,” she said in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Trump reopened that chapter again, on Jan. 7, 2025, even before his inauguration, when he said for the first time that he wouldn’t rule out using military force to get Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same day, the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., made a lightning quick visit to Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, in the depths of winter, ostensibly for business. His appearance drew a band of pro-Trump social media influencers dressed in bulky snowsuits and American flags who passed out $100 bills, which turned off many Greenlanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next week, Ms. Frederiksen held a heated phone call with Mr. Trump. According to European officials who were briefed afterward, Mr. Trump berated her for 45 minutes. She did not want to talk about that one either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A phone call between two colleagues has to be a phone call between two colleagues,” she told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Winther, who co-wrote a biography about her — “Mette F” — in 2019, traces her cool self-assuredness and penchant for underdog causes to her childhood home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father, Flemming Frederiksen, was a typographer, union leader and active member of the Social Democrats. He worked in a newspaper production room as the paper was transitioning into the automated era and stood up for workers about to be rendered obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people ask me: ‘When did you get interested in politics?’ I don’t know what to say,” Ms. Frederiksen said during our interview. “I cannot remember not being interested in politics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was shy, she said, but also strident. After recounting the run-in with the skinhead in high school, she said, “I don’t know if it tells something about my character, maybe it tells us more about his.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first political party she joined was the youth wing of the African National Congress. She rapidly rose through the ranks of the youth wing of the Social Democrats, winning a seat in 2001 to Denmark’s parliament. Mr. Winter said she arrived with “extraordinary confidence, you know, the confidence you can only feel when you are very young.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, she had a different look — casual clothes, spiky hair. She quickly gained a reputation for being a strong public speaker and unafraid of taking on party elders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her tenure has been marked by crisis. During the Covid pandemic her government abruptly ordered a cull of millions of minks (raised for fur), fearful they could spread the virus. It was a controversial decision and resulted in several high-level resignations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She survived the fallout and ultimately was credited with guiding Denmark through those years with relatively low infections while keeping public services as open as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Vladimir V. Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, she called for Europe to act. She was among the first on the continent to commit F-16 fighter jets to the Ukrainian military and boosted weapons production for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her country, like some others, has been the victim of unsolved drone incursions widely believed to have been instigated by Russia, perhaps as payback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On immigration, she has put in place some of Europe’s harshest asylum rules — including utilizing camps abroad and family separations. The moves have been criticized by human rights groups but have sharply reduced arrivals and shored her up politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we spoke with her in September, she was visiting Greenland to apologize for Danish doctors forcing contraception on Greenlandic women and girls, part of a long abusive colonial legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Danish political analysts give her high marks for how she has handled Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s difficult for me to really find any major errors,” said Ulrik Pram Gad, a respected academic on Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Gad said that as Mr. Trump began to get aggressive about Greenland, Ms. Frederiksen did a good job of coordinating with Greenlandic officials and rallying European capitals, such as London and Paris, “trying to get our message out of other people’s mouths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason? Denmark needs Greenland. With it, Denmark is the world’s 12th largest sovereign state. It sits on the Arctic Council, the leading international forum for Arctic affairs. It keeps its special (though now troubled) relationship to the United States, which has been protecting Greenland since World War II and maintains a military base at the northern end of the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When they don’t have Greenland anymore, they will lose 98 percent of their area,” said Pele Broberg, the leader of a Greenlandic political party that has been critical of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So it’s very simple,” Mr. Broberg said. “They’re important as long as they own us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen, for her part, has supported Greenland’s autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The future of Greenland belongs to the Greenlandic people,” she said. “It’s more two countries now working together than an old colony, with all what is included in that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 50-minute interview, Ms. Frederiksen was more comfortable talking foreign affairs than about her own life. She is on her second marriage, with a Danish cinematographer, Bo Tengberg, and together they are raising five children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside politics, she finds respite in spending time at the family summer house, cooking and preserving food, and staying fit through spinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said one of her most important guiding principles was keeping Europe’s alliance with America strong — or at least intact. As recently as 2024, she said that she wouldn’t allow “a single piece of paper” to slip between the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past week, she has said that she still believes in a close relationship with the United States, citing “a common interest in ensuring our security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some Europeans have loved the U.S. because of dollars and ‘Dallas’ and so on. That’s not how I am,” she told us. “I really believe that everything would have gone wrong for Europe if it wasn’t for D-Day and for the big role of the U.S. in ending the Second World War.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You saved us,” she said. “And by the way, you have done that again and again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So my starting point is that I will do whatever I can to keep us together in this world, and therefore I’m not starting a conflict,” she said. “I’m trying to solve a conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/multimedia/25int-iran-internet-tpfb/25int-iran-internet-tpfb-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than 17 days, Iranians have withstood not only a brutal crackdown to quell nationwide protests, but also a near-total communications blackout. Now some Iranians, eager to reconnect with the world, are managing to gain sporadic but brief internet access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Iranians have used the quick windows to send their first messages to loved ones to reassure them they are alive, relatives said. But the openings have also allowed Iranians to send more extensive messages and videos abroad, giving journalists and rights groups a widening view of the extent of the government crackdown and its toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the limited information being gleaned indicates that thousands more Iranians may have been killed than the estimated 5,200 previously reported, according to some human rights groups working to verify the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how some Iranians are managing to connect, even as monitoring of Iran’s internet indicates that the shutdown remains in place. Internet experts said the moments are probably related to the Iranian authorities’ efforts to lift the shutdown while also maintaining tight censorship filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every time I connect, it takes a year off my life,” Mahsa, a 39-year-old in Tehran, wrote in a message during a window of connectivity. “I prefer to turn a blind eye and remain in the dark and in this state of uncertainty and despair.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many people in Iran, Mahsa asked that her full name be withheld for her safety. She was among more than a dozen people in Iran reached in recent days by New York Times journalists and who described being able to gain fleeting online access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demonstrations in Iran were initially set off in some cities in late December by worsening economic hardship and a currency crisis, but they quickly spread nationwide — and into direct calls to overthrow the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response the authorities shut down Iran’s internet on Jan. 8 as security forces began a fierce campaign to suppress the protests. International calls have also been blocked, while domestic phone calls work reliably only until the evening, according to the few residents who managed to speak to The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blackout had made it nearly impossible for journalists and human rights groups, let alone Iranians themselves, to ascertain the scope of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brief openings to the internet may slowly help change some of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said that as of Friday it had verified more than 5,000 deaths, and that it was seeking to verify more than 17,000 possible deaths in all as new information trickles out of Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet censorship in the Islamic Republic is not new — the authorities have been blocking websites since 2005, including Facebook and Instagram. During previous anti-government protests, the authorities temporarily shut down the internet in restive areas. In June, during the 12-day war with Israel, it imposed a near-total shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this blackout is the longest and most extensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sporadic access for Iranians is creating “a twilight zone where users are neither online nor offline,” said Alp Toker, the director of the internet monitoring group NetBlocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The openings may be the result of people trying to access the internet as the authorities experiment with methods to “whitelist” users, said Amir Rashidi, a cybersecurity expert with Miaan, a digital rights group focused on Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitelisting is what Iran’s internet activists call state efforts to essentially offer different levels of connectivity, based on people’s political loyalties or ability to pay for access, or their need for the internet — such as for businesses or academic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At times, for a few minutes, parts of the network appear to be unfiltered, but this quickly reverts back to a full internet shutdown,” Mr. Rashidi said. “All of this points to an effort to aggressively expand whitelisting, ultimately moving toward a form of tiered or class-based internet access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more authorities experiment with whitelisting, he added, “the more gaps and unintended pathways for connectivity will emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current shutdown is costing Iran’s economy between $16 million to $24 million a day at the current exchange rate, according to Donya-ye Eqtesad, Iran’s most widely read financial newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the reformist newspaper Khabaronline, Majid Reza Hariri, the head of the Iran-China Chamber of Commerce, said that traders now receive internet access for 20 minutes a day under supervision, “which in no way meets the needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-affiliated news channels have reported that the return to internet connectivity first began with access to Google search and then expanded to Iran’s “domestic internet” — walled-off versions of social media and websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scale and extent of what happened in Iran are not yet clear, even inside the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yashar Soltani, a prominent investigative journalist in Tehran, posted on X that the scale of death was “a tragedy whose true dimensions are still shrouded in obscurity and censorship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote, “The truth, even if they hide it, will not disappear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiana Hayeri and Pranav Baskar contributed reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/25int-venezuela-disappeared-new-54446-cover/25int-venezuela-disappeared-new-54446-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking a 10-hour bus ride across Venezuela in a quest to find her missing husband, Carolina Carrizo fashioned a makeshift bed out of discarded sofa cushions to sleep outside Zona 7, a detention center in Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, she said, about 30 uniformed police officers looking for weapons forced their way inside her home in western Venezuela and took her husband, Omar Torres, 53, a political activist. The authorities never acknowledged the arrest, she said, and she has not heard from him since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has slept outside Zona 7 since arriving in Caracas two weeks ago. She is not even sure that he is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Trump administration’s capture of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, its interim government has drawn international headlines for releasing dozens of political prisoners who rights groups say were wrongfully detained. The trickle of releases has shone a renewed spotlight on a related phenomenon in Venezuela: people who were arrested, largely for political reasons, and then disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s words of praise for what he says is the accommodating attitude of the interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, has made families in Venezuela hopeful that the newfound cooperation between the two countries could bring freedom for dozens of people who were taken without a trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re all here, outside the prisons, because of Trump, because of what he did,” Ms. Carrizo said. “Now I just want my husband back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two weeks, other mothers, wives and girlfriends from across Venezuela have slept on the street outside Zona 7, where their tents sit next to dozens of police officers wielding riot shields. The police claim the jail is empty, but the families say that they have heard screams coming from inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel that Trump is the one who is going to get them out,” said Betsy Orellana, who said her son, Rodolfo José Rodríguez Orellana, a former police officer, is serving a 24-year sentence for participating in a plot to overthrow the government. He has been missing since August, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The locations of at least 66 prisoners are unknown in Venezuela, according to Foro Penal, a leading rights group, which tracks politically motivated detentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those, about 30 of them, like Ms. Orellana’s son, were arrested during an attempted invasion of Venezuela in 2020 known as Operation Gideon. The effort to topple Mr. Maduro, hatched by an American former Green Beret, failed spectacularly: Eight would-be rebels were killed and the rest are still in prison, and have not been heard from since being transferred in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Venezuelan government did not respond to requests for comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forced disappearances is a decades-old practice that became a notorious tool used by Latin American dictatorships against critics — from foreigners to students and political activists. The practice is categorized as a violation of international law and a crime against humanity because the authorities are obligated to acknowledge when a person is in police custody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Venezuela, some people have been missing for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Venezuelan law, detainees are supposed to be brought before a court within 48 hours, a provision that human rights activists say is often ignored. But in the cases of the disappeared, the families do not even know where they are being held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Venezuelan government unleashed a harsh crackdown, called “Operation Knock-Knock,” to stamp out dissent after a July 2024 presidential election that Mr. Maduro claimed to have won despite vote tallies showing he lost decisively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 800 people considered political prisoners are still detained after 154 were released in recent days, according to Foro Penal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in a countries where human rights are frequently violated, the disappearance of inmates is considered particularly serious because the detainees are outside the protection of the law, human rights experts said. It is difficult for families to hire defense lawyers for a case that officially does not exist, making the defendant particularly vulnerable, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International, in a report last year, said Venezuela saw a significant increase in forced disappearances after the 2024 elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People would disappear for hours, days, weeks or months, the organization said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clara del Campo, the South America campaigner for Amnesty International, said families “literally” knock on prison doors asking for their loved ones, but the guards claim no one by that name is in custody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It speaks to the ingenuity of repressive governments whereby they find new ways of applying cruelty and punishing those that they consider real or perceived dissidents,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “desaparecido” became common in the 1970s in Argentina, when a military dictatorship abducted as many as 30,000 people, tortured them and, in hundreds of cases, threw them from airplanes into the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the term was largely considered synonymous with “missing and most likely dead.” In more recent years, the practice became commonplace in countries like Nicaragua, where missing people are believed to be alive but imprisoned, with no records to document it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nicaragua, several dozen people who were detained and missing were recently released, but nine remain unaccounted for, according to a prisoner monitoring group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, Victor Borges, 39, a political activist, has been missing since Nov. 25, relatives said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is as if the earth swallowed him,” said his former partner, Yesley Bello, 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnesses told Ms. Bello that vehicles bearing the insignia of Venezuela’s Bolivarian National Police arrived at Mr. Borges’s workplace, an elite private school, where he cared for animals at the school’s petting zoo, and took him away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His family can rattle off the names of government agencies, prisons, hospitals, police stations and morgues where they have gone to ask about him. Each time, the family said, they were told the same thing: No one by that name was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Bello has begun to consider the possibility that he may never return to her or his five children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will tell them about the great father they had,” she said, her eyes filling with tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martina Rapido, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, said that forced disappearance is “always a strategy to break not only the person who is detained, but also their families, sometimes in retaliation for political opposition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Rapido said the disappearances generally fit one of two patterns. They are often short-term detentions that last a few days. But others involve high-profile activists who are held incommunicado for an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marilis Rodríguez, 58, traveled 200 miles to Caracas recently from the city of Acarigua searching of her son, Carlos José Rodríguez Rodríguez. She said the police took Mr. Rodríguez, 29, from his home on Sept. 23, 2025, after accusing him of illegally selling dollars on the black market, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My son was taken from his house for an investigation,” Ms. Rodríguez said. “They were going to question him about something, and it’s going to be four months since we last heard from him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said her son, a vendor of imported goods, was not politically active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she was told at one prison in Caracas that he had been released, only to be told a day later that it was not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rodríguez’s first child, a boy, was born after he was taken, so they have yet to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family said it had tried to find him in at least five prisons in Caracas and also asked about him at every police station in Acarigua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve turned the town of Acarigua upside down,” said Adriana Graterol, a cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leomaris Prado traveled eight hours by bus from Guárico State to El Helicoide, a prison with a reputation as a center for torture in Caracas, looking for her father. Leonardo Prado, a mechanic, has been missing since Dec. 28, when she said he was stopped at a checkpoint and taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father was not politically active, Ms. Prado said, but had recently gotten into a dispute with noisy neighbors who happened to be police officers, and his family now wonders whether that triggered his detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m here because I want proof that my father is alive,” Ms. Prado said. “I want them to tell me where he is. I want them to tell me why they took him. I want them to show me the evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/multimedia/25int-japan-gender-01-cwbl/25int-japan-gender-01-cwbl-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo reached its adrenaline-pumping conclusion on Sunday, thousands of spectators cheered as star athletes were feted inside Japan’s most prestigious wrestling ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But someone was missing: Japan’s prime minister, who typically hands out a giant gilded trophy at the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanae Takaichi, the first woman to serve as prime minister in Japan’s history, skipped the ceremony, yielding to a longstanding ban on women inside the sumo ring, known as the dohyo. She dispatched the Japanese education minister, a man, to read a certificate on her behalf; officials said she wanted to respect sumo’s “traditional culture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was in keeping with the cautious approach to gender issues taken by Ms. Takaichi, a hard-line conservative who is seeking to expand her power in a snap election next month. Since breaking the glass ceiling in October, she has rarely spoken about the historical significance of her election, choosing instead to define feminism on her own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than denounce sexism in Japanese society, Ms. Takaichi has leaned into public discussions about her clothing and appearance. She has emphasized traditional values, balancing her career with caring for her ailing husband. And she has sought to project an image as a warm, determined leader who loves to “work and work and work and work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Ms. Takaichi’s election has helped normalize the image of powerful women in Japan’s patriarchal society, her critics say that she should do more to promote gender equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She is sending the message that a woman is not an ornament — that women can be outspoken and driven,” said Kumiko Nemoto, a sociology professor at Senshu University in Tokyo. “Yet her vision of feminism has done little, so far, to advance the cause of gender equality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the campaign, Ms. Takaichi promised to bring “Nordic levels” of gender equality, which are typically closer to 50 percent, to her cabinet. But only two of the 18 members she appointed were women. That came plainly into view during a visit to Japan this month by Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister. Ms. Takaichi invited Ms. Meloni, the only other female leader among the Group of 7 nations, to pose for photographs with the women in her cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other conservative women in politics, including Ms. Meloni and Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, Ms. Takaichi has embraced policies that critics say have eroded women’s rights. She opposes changing a longstanding law that requires married couples to share a surname, and she has backed efforts to preserve the male lineage of Japan’s imperial family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her supporters say that she embraces a different type of feminism, one that focuses on concerns about women’s safety and health. She has endorsed, for example, an effort to build more bathrooms for women in Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waka Ikeda, a commentator and researcher, wrote this month in The Japan Times newspaper that Ms. Takaichi was pushing a version of conservative feminism that was rooted in the idea of working within existing structures, rather than “revolutionary transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t anti-feminist,” she wrote. “It’s a different feminist tradition, one that resonates with Japan’s silent majority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Takaichi hinted at her vision when she invited two dozen women serving as ambassadors to Japan to her office this month. She told the ambassadors that she had aspired to be Japan’s prime minister — not its “first female prime minister.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I go about my daily work without giving much thought to it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She warned about the “glass cliff,” a phenomenon in which women are appointed to steer organizations through crisis, only to be set up for failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It leads to the prejudice that women are not suited to being leaders,” she said. “Let’s work hard together and produce results in order to eradicate such words.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Takaichi has at times been the subject of sexist tropes. When President Trump visited Tokyo shortly after her election, commentators dissected her body language, saying she appeared too friendly when she locked arms with Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her sartorial choices — she favors blue suits and black handbags — have also been a frequent topic of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawmaker in Parliament recently criticized her clothes, saying that she should wear “Japan’s finest fabrics and those crafted by its top artisans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Takaichi responded with a lengthy meditation on social media about the stress she felt choosing clothes for high-profile events like the Group of 20 summit in South Africa. She wrote that she was heeding the lawmaker’s advice and had spent several hours selecting “clothes that don’t look cheap” and that “won’t get me looked down upon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Grand Sumo tournament, which took place over 15 days this month, was seen as a test of how substantially Ms. Takaichi might seek to change Japan’s cultural norms. She skipped another sumo event in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minoru Kihara, the chief cabinet secretary, said earlier this week that the government, in deciding how to deal with the sumo awards ceremony, was considering the “prime minister’s intention that she would like to value the traditional culture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japan Sumo Association said in a statement that it was “committed to the success of the traditional culture of Grand Sumo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumo aficionados expressed disappointment that Ms. Takaichi did not present the trophy as many of her male predecessors had. Over the years, several female officials in Japan have lobbied the association for permission to enter the ring. The group has rejected their requests; it came under fire at one point for forcing a female mayor to speak from a podium outside the ring instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Takaichi “is the last person who wants to change women’s rights or promote feminism,” said Shizuka Wada, an author who has been critical of sumo culture. “This tradition will never change so long as she is prime minister.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women have long been banned from professional sumo rings in Japan. In the Shinto faith, one of the country’s main religions, they are considered impure because of menstruation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomoko Nakagawa, a former mayor of the city of Takarazuka, said Ms. Takaichi had a chance to help advance women’s rights. As mayor in 2018, Ms. Nakagawa was rejected by the sumo association when she tried to make a speech inside a training stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Women are treated as unclean even in the modern era,” she said. “Will she allow such a tradition to last in the future? I expect the prime minister to raise some questions at some point.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/world/middleeast/1-ILAM_2x3-still/1-ILAM_2x3-still-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Tehran, the capital of Iran, security forces opened fire at protesters from the roof of a police station. In Karaj, they fired live rounds into a march, shooting one person in the head. In Isfahan, young men barricaded themselves in an alley as gunfire and explosions rang out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scattered protests had percolated since late December, starting with a strike in Tehran’s bazaar and fueled by a plunging economy. But by early January, Iranians had revolted en masse, and the security forces began to crack down with deadly force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not just the protests unnerving the regime. President Trump encouraged the demonstrators and threatened military intervention. In many places, riots flared in parallel with peaceful protests; government buildings, commercial properties, mosques and police stations were set on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Jan. 9, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the Supreme National Security Council, the body tasked with safeguarding the country, to crush the protests by any means necessary, according to two Iranian officials briefed on the ayatollah’s directive. Security forces were deployed with orders to shoot to kill and to show no mercy, the officials said. The death toll surged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Iran shutting down the internet and disrupting phone service, some Iranians managed to evade restrictions to share witness accounts and hundreds of videos, many of which The New York Times was able to collect and authenticate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times has verified videos of security forces opening fire on protesters in at least 19 different cities and in at least six different neighborhoods in Tehran in early January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources: Verified footage; Institute for the Study of War and American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats Project (all protests)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These videos show the breadth and ferocity of the regime’s crackdown. So do the testimonies of doctors and a nurse working in hospitals in Iran, and photographs shared by a witness and authenticated by The Times of hundreds of victims brought to a Tehran morgue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times also interviewed two dozen Iranians in Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Rasht and Ahvaz who had attended protests, as well as relatives of people killed. Protesters, residents and medical staff interviewed for this article all asked that their names or full names not be published for fear of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Monday, Jan. 12, the protests had largely been crushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more information emerges from Iran, the death toll has hit at least 5,200 people, including 56 children, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group that also monitors the situation in Iran, has confirmed at least 3,400 killed. Both organizations say that the numbers could prove two or three times larger as verification continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran’s National Security Council said in a statement that 3,117 people had been killed, among them 427 of its security forces. Officials, including Mr. Khamenei, have blamed terrorist cells tied to Israel and the United States for the uprising and killings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is not merely a violent protest crackdown. It is a state-orchestrated massacre,” said Raha Bahreini, a lawyer and an Iran researcher at Amnesty International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 8, Nasim Pouraghayee, 45, a mother of two, and her husband, Ali, marched with large crowds in the Sadeghiyeh neighborhood in Tehran. She called her mother to say the atmosphere was boisterous and the turnout huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abruptly, things turned deadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her husband was walking behind her, hands wrapped around her shoulders to protect her, according to a cousin of Ms. Pouraghayee’s who, in an interview, recounted the events of the night as described by Ali. A bullet hit Ms. Pouraghayee in the neck; she fell to the ground and began vomiting blood, the cousin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nasim, Nasim, Nasim,” her husband screamed, holding her face. But she was unresponsive. “Help, help,” he pleaded to other protesters fleeing the chaos, but nobody came forward. He felt his wife’s body getting cold as he picked her up, the cousin said, and walked for an hour and a half to reach their car. When they reached the hospital, she was pronounced dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video verified by The Times captured the sound of live fire being directed at protesters in Sadeghiyeh. The protesters turn, flee and scream as gunshots are heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 40 verified videos show gunmen and security forces cracking down on demonstrations. Across the footage, they are seen riding in pairs on motorbikes and using a variety of weapons, including firearms, batons and tear gas. In a video filmed in Haft Howz Square in Tehran, men and women flee amid the sound of gunfire. Some protesters clearly have leg wounds, and leave trails of blood along a sidewalk as they limp away, a video verified by The Times showed. On the street, some can also be seen carrying people unable to walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohammad, 40, a shop owner, said he and his younger brother were among the demonstrators in Tehran Pars, a middle-class neighborhood in eastern Tehran, on Friday, Jan. 9, when they heard the rat-tat-tat of gunfire. “I saw two young men who were running away collapse; they were shot from the back,” Mohammad said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security forces fired on protesters from the rooftop of a police station in Tehran Pars for more than six minutes, one video shows. The video shows the muzzle blasts of several rifles and picks up the sound of hundreds of gunshots and what appears to be automatic fire. A group of protesters run away along an adjacent street. Minutes later, a person is dragged inside the courtyard of the police station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another video filmed farther along the same street — and in the direction the security forces were firing — shows protesters sheltering from incoming gunfire. “Put your phone down, they’ll shoot your hand off,” one person says. “There’s a sniper among them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound of bullets striking nearby can be heard amid chants of “Death to Khamenei.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video that The Times confirmed was filmed at the nearby Tehran Pars Hospital showed several body bags lined up on the ground outside an emergency room entrance as people could be heard wailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A husband and wife had a violent encounter with members of the Basij militia, a plainclothes security force, on motorcycles in Karim Khan in central Tehran. The wife, 50, who is a designer, said in an interview that the men shot indiscriminately into the air and at people, and screamed, “Get back inside.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The husband was shot in his lower back with a pellet bullet. The wife said a member of the Basij found her hiding behind an electric pole, stood near her and pointed a gun to her forehead, several millimeters away from her eye. He threatened to kill her, but had run out bullets, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of videos verified by The Times from Jan. 8 in Fardis, a suburb of Karaj, showed hundreds of people marching, then fleeing when a tear-gas canister is fired in their direction. Gunshots ring out. Another video, filmed near a police station in Fardis, shows a protester who appears to have been shot in the head. More than two dozen gunshots are heard as screaming protesters take cover. In the last video, the lifeless bodies of seven people sprawl on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mashhad, a conservative city in the northeast, huge crowds gathered on Jan. 8 chanting slogans against the government, a video verified by The Times showed. Later that night, a group of protesters were walking down a road about a mile away from where the crowds had been when security forces on motorcycles rode up to them. Some of the officers dismounted and beat demonstrators with batons, while others fanned out, pointing firearms down the street as gunshots rang out nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another video filmed at a protest in Mashhad and verified by The Times, a person is seen lying on the ground as others run to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, they shot a girl,” the person recording the video said. “They are using weapons of war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the country, hospitals swamped by thousands of injured protesters were unprepared for the scale of the gunshot wounds they were seeing, according to interviews and text messages with eight doctors and one nurse in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gun violence is rare in Iran, and private citizens are not allowed to own weapons. The doctors and the nurse sharing their experiences in Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan and Zanjan described scenes of chaos: medical staff frantically trying to save lives, white uniforms drenched in blood. They said patients lay on benches and chairs, and even on bare floors, in the overcrowded emergency rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said hospitals were short of blood and searching for trauma and vascular surgeons. The internet shutdown prevented medical staff from checking patients’ names and medical history, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nurse at Nikan Hospital in Tehran said in an interview that the hospital resembled a war zone. A doctor at Shohada Tajrish Hospital in north Tehran, a sprawling government medical facility, said that, on average, medical staff saw about 70 protesters with gunshot wounds per hour on the two days of peak violence, Jan. 9 and 10. Many patients were dead on arrival or shortly afterward, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an audio message shared with The Times, a physician in Mashhad called the situation at his hospital “terrifying.” In addition to a staggering number of injured protesters, he said, security forces showed up demanding access to patients to arrest them. He said a team of physicians had set up an ad hoc triage unit at a villa outside of the city, where they treated patients too afraid to go to hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anesthesiologist at a hospital in the Sattar Khan neighborhood of Tehran said in a text message shared with The Times that in just one night, his hospital had seen 300 injured protesters. A text message from a doctor at a university hospital in Zanjan shared with The Times said most victims were shot in the upper torso, head and neck, and that the hospital had recorded about 200 killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times received photos and videos from inside hospitals that are too gruesome to show. Other very graphic images were posted online by an account with a record of publishing images later found to be authentic. They showed bloody, lifeless bodies inside hospitals said to be in Tehran. Some victims appeared to have been shot in the head. The Times was unable to independently authenticate the images from inside hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farabi Eye Hospital in Tehran, a national hub for ophthalmology, registered about 500 cases of eye injury from pellet bullets on Jan. 8 and several hundred eye injuries with live bullets on the following two nights, a surgeon said in a text message. He was in the operating room for three nights straight and said he wished for death when he had to empty both eye sockets of a 13-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doctor in Isfahan said in a text message that they had seen “young people whose brains were smashed with live bullets, and a mom who was shot in the neck, her two small children were crying in the car, a child whose bladder, hip and rectum was crushed with a bullet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I witnessed will forever haunt me,” the doctor added. “I feel guilty that I’m alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos, videos and text conversations shared with The Times by Dr. Kayvan Mirhadi, an Iranian American doctor in Rochester, N.Y., who has been in regular contact with medical teams and hospitals in Iran, showed dozens of apparent gunshot and pellet wounds to the torso, limbs, head and eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are essentially executing people on the streets,” Dr. Mirhadi said. “Starting Thursday, the reports of injuries I was receiving changed significantly. It went from brute force, fractures and tear gas to skull fractures and gunshot wounds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some images shared by Dr. Mirhadi were sent by people asking how to treat their own wounds or those of relatives. One person asked about a bullet wound in his brother’s leg. Another sent a photo of an eye, with blood pouring out of a gash just above it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times sent a representative sample of 17 images to experts from the Independent Forensic Expert Group coordinated by the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, who determined that the injuries appeared to be caused by buckshot or birdshot fired at close range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HRANA, the rights agency in Washington, documented a significant number of injuries from pellet gunfire during recent protests, including shots into the eyeball. It said 7,402 people had serious injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video obtained by the London-based Persian-language news channel Iran International and verified by The Times shows bodies in the courtyard of Alghadir Hospital, less than a mile from where protesters were fired upon and injured in Haft Howz Square. Some of the bodies are covered and tied in plastic bags; others are wrapped in blankets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman crouches over the body of a man wrapped in a blanket whose eyes remain closed. She weeps and speaks to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodies shrouded in black plastic bags covered every space and surface. Stacked in refrigerators. Placed on the floor inside. Scattered, row after row, on the ground in the parking lot and courtyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tehran’s main morgue, Kahrizak Forensic Center, was overflowing in the immediate aftermath of the killing spree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of bodies overwhelmed the capacity of the morgue, a government official admitted on state television, blaming the killings on terrorist cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the handling and processing of bodies was also disorderly, according to videos and a person who visited the morgue. Families searching for loved ones were taken to a hall where a television screen flashed the faces of the dead, each with a number assigned to it. There were several photos of some victims because the severity of their injuries required multiple angles to identify them, according to the visitor to the morgue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes families would ask the morgue staff to pause, rewind and zoom in, the visitor said. Others would immediately recognize a loved one and collapse. People screamed, wailed and hit their faces and bodies in shock and grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple images and videos verified by The Times showed hundreds of bodies laid out at the Kahrizak morgue within days of the protests erupting on Jan. 8. Outside the center, men unzipped black body bags as they searched for missing relatives. Others tearfully embraced as they discovered bodies. Inside a large hall where dozens more were laid out, women wailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One 16-minute video filmed outside the center showed close to 300 victims laid out on sidewalks and asphalt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a line. A line of people, so they can pick up their deceased,” the person filming said. “The young people. Their apple of their eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff in white lab coats unzipped body bags and examined victims’ wounds. One staff member identified a wound at the back of one victim’s head, blood trailing from it, and jotted details in a notebook. Another documented apparent bullet wounds on the torso of a bloodied victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the camera moved through the crowd, people could be seen going from body to body searching for a loved one. Men embraced tearfully over the dead body of someone they identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one heartbreaking video, a father sobbed as he searched inside the center for his son, Sepehr Shokri, 19, a boxer. “Sepehr, my son, where are you?” he cried. “Damn Khamenei, this is his crime. Sepehr, Baba, where are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times obtained photographs of over 300 bodies brought to Kahrizak. The photographs showed the faces of the dead, the top of their black body bags unzipped, with white identity cards on their chests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens were marked as “unknown man,” “unknown woman,” “unknown child.” Over 190 were marked only by numbers. The Times identified 29 legible names, among them Mohammad Erfan Faraji, 18, who an Iranian rights organization reported was shot during protests in Shahr Rey, a suburb of Tehran about 10 miles from the morgue where his body was photographed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times could not make a conclusive assessment of injuries based on the images. But a majority of the bodies showed severe head trauma, large gashes and collapsed eye sockets. Some were severely disfigured. Several still had tubes in their mouths and EKG pads on their chests, indicating the bodies had been transported from a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nizam Peerwani, a forensic adviser for Physicians for Human Rights who analyzed the images for The Times, said the evidence suggested multiple victims had been “brutally bludgeoned or beaten up at the scene or in detention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one woman recognized her husband on the screen and dropped to the floor, another woman approached her, said the person who was at the morgue. She told her, “Get up, get up my dear, you have work to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Iran, funerals are taking place. Parents are burying children. Children are burying parents. Siblings, friends, neighbors, colleagues, classmates and teammates are attending burial processions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the faces and stories of the victims surface, recounted by relatives or friends and posted on social media, so does the story of the uprising. The protesters killed represent a broad swath of Iran, ethnically, economically and socially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many were very young. Teenagers and people in their early twenties took to the streets with dreams of a better life, of a prosperous future and of freedom, their families say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 21-year-old basketball star who played for a national team; a 17-year-old Kurdish soccer player with a national youth club; a 15-year-old swimming champion; a 19-year-old college student majoring in Italian; a 26-year-old English teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death on Jan. 8 of Sina Ashkbousi, 17, was described by his aunt in an audio message posted on the Instagram page of lawyers in Iran who represent human rights cases. “Sina was killed with a direct bullet in his heart in Tehran Pars,” she said. “He was very smart, a dreamer. He was after freedom and was very kind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funerals have turned into protests, with thousands of attendees holding pictures of victims and chanting “Death to Khamenei,” videos verified by The Times show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footage showed huge crowds at a funeral for three people killed in Malekshahi, a rural area in the province of Ilam, on Jan. 4. A week later, videos circulating on social media appeared to show huge crowds not far away, in Abdanan, another city in Ilam, for the funeral of Alireza Saidi, 16, who was said to have been killed in Tehran during protests that week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At these funerals and that of Ahmad Khosravani, the basketball star, the crowd departed from the traditional mourning rituals of crying and reciting the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead they clapped, cheered and chanted in unison, saying, “This fallen flower is a gift to the nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________MethodologyDespite a communications blackout, Iranians managed to use virtual private networks, or VPNs, and forbidden Starlink satellite internet systems to share witness accounts and videos, many of which The New York Times was able to collect and authenticate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some videos were shared directly with Times journalists. Others with Iranian human rights groups, BBC Persian and the Iranian blog Vahid Online, all of whom circulated the videos on Telegram, X and Instagram.The Times collected over 300 videos and independently verified over 160 of them by matching details seen in the videos — like business names, street fronts, signs and trees — with archival images, satellite imagery and Google Street View. Iranian reporters with The Times watched and listened to the videos for accents or other details indicating their authenticity. Sometimes we referred to verification carried out by GeoConfirmed, a research collective that specializes in geolocating where videos are filmed.The Times independently confirmed all the videos reported on for this story. Two weeks on from the worst of the violence, footage is still emerging. Confirming the date those videos were filmed is not always possible. But by checking that the videos are new and not posted during previous crackdowns in Iran, and by mapping out when and where protests and crackdowns happened in January, we corroborated the date they were most likely taken.&lt;/p&gt;
