&lt;p&gt;The French are known for their style. So when President Emmanuel Macron addressed the World Economic Forum on Tuesday, it was striking to see him wearing sunglasses indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A medical issue, however, and not the dictates of fashion, prompted Mr. Macron to take the stage in Davos, Switzerland, in a pair of blue-tinted aviator-style glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Macron did not acknowledge his unconventional choice of spectacles during his 18-minute speech. The sunglasses made their first appearance last Thursday, when he sported an inflamed right eye during a New Year’s speech to France’s armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please pardon the unsightly appearance of my eye,” he told the troops, after removing the glasses for the speech, adding that the condition was “completely harmless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French news reports have indicated that Mr. Macron has been suffering from broken blood vessels in his eye. The condition is known medically as a subconjunctival hemorrhage, which can be caused by trauma, coughing, sneezing, high blood pressure or medications like blood thinners, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The condition typically goes away without treatment within two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some leaders have used their speeches in Davos to challenge President Trump’s increasingly bellicose posture to traditional allies of the United States. On Tuesday, Mr. Macron warned of a “shift toward a world without rules,” referring to the growing disregard for international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules of etiquette, which forbid wearing sunglasses indoors, could be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On social media, Mr. Macron’s sunglasses were seen as a political statement, projecting a tough image in the face of Mr. Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on French wine and champagne and to annex Greenland. He has previously used his clothing to send a message, donning a turtleneck in the winter of 2022 as Europe contended with an energy crisis in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people likened the bespectacled Mr. Macron to the naval aviator played by Tom Cruise in “Top Gun.” Others recalled former President Joe Biden’s penchant for aviators, though Mr. Biden was not known to wear his sunglasses while addressing world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Macron’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22int-theworld-trump-greenland-promo/22int-theworld-trump-greenland-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fate of Greenland has loomed large this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Long before Trump arrived, it was all anyone wanted to talk about. While waiting in line for the many security checks. In the corridors of the sprawling conference center. At the bar after hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ladies’ room, I stumbled across a group of French diplomats touching up their makeup while listing ways Europeans could retaliate. A session titled “Can Europe Defend Itself?” was wildly oversubscribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started with a lot of anticipation for Trump’s speech to the forum, during which he addressed the topic of Greenland, ruling out the use of force, but, seemingly, threatening economic warfare. It ended with Trump calling off those threats, saying on social media that he had reached a framework agreement with Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, “with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement followed a NATO meeting on Wednesday where top military officers discussed a compromise in which Denmark would give the United States sovereignty over small pockets of the island where the United States could build military bases, according to three senior officials familiar with the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, there are still many questions — and many objections to any sort of deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaja Chemnitz, one of the two Greenlandic members of the Danish parliament and a major political figure in Greenland, rejected Trump’s negotiations with NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we are witnessing these days in statements from Trump is completely absurd. NATO has absolutely no mandate to negotiate anything whatsoever without us in Greenland,” she said in a post on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speech in Davos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Trump had taken the main stage at the World Economic Forum, in an auditorium packed with hundreds of elected and business leaders, who patiently listened to him boast about turning the U.S. into the “hottest country” in the world. (Our fact check of the speech is here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he pivoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Would you like me to say a few words about Greenland?” Trump asked. There were a few scattered chuckles. But they quickly turned into an anxious silence, punctuated by audible gasps, as the president lashed out at NATO allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ruled out the use of force, which came as a surprise to some: “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he did seem to threaten economic and security consequences for Europe if the United States wasn’t allowed to purchase the island — only to reverse course hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential deal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we know about a potential deal is very limited. Officials speaking to my colleagues on condition of anonymity compared the idea of giving the U.S. sovereignty over small parts of Greenland to Britain’s military bases in Cyprus, which are regarded as British territory. (The officials said they did not know if that idea had inspired the framework announced by Trump.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a day of whiplash, and the status of negotiations is still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a degree of relief among some European leaders when Trump ruled out an invasion to claim the island, and some Greenlanders and Danes expressed hope at the prospect of a potential solution. Lars Lokke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, told a Danish television channel that the day ended better than it began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This morning we had a president who would not rule out taking Greenland by force. Now he says he will not take Greenland by force,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland — or Iceland, as Trump called it a couple of times — Europe and NATO were not the only targets of Trump in his speech. Here’s a look at everything (and everyone) Trump targeted at Davos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week, Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada received a standing ovation when he declared that the world order had undergone “a rupture.” Carney’s view is widely shared here. And that feeling looks certain to remain, whatever happens next with Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The depth of the rift between Trump and Europe has been on full display. This evening, E.U. leaders will gather in Brussels to try and figure out what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, leaders have gathered in Davos to discuss a shared economic and political future. Yesterday, Trump transformed the forum into the setting of a dramatic rupture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. announced yesterday that it had moved 150 Islamic State fighters from a detention facility in northeastern Syria to Iraq and that it might eventually move up to 7,000 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transfer followed concerns that thousands of former ISIS fighters and their family members could escape from detention as the Syrian government and Kurdish-led forces vie for control of the area. The 150 fighters were taken to an unspecified “secure location in Iraq,” the U.S. Central Command said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kurdish-led militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., agreed on Sunday to hand over control of the prisons to the Syrian government. The transition has been rocky. In recent days, detainees escaped from at least one prison amid skirmishes. Chaos appeared to break out after S.D.F. forces abruptly withdrew from the Al Hol detention camp, which houses tens of thousands of family members of ISIS fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our economics reporters — based in New York, London, Brussels, Berlin, Hong Kong and Seoul — are digging into every aspect of the tariffs causing global turmoil. They are joined by dozens of reporters writing about the effects on everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S.D.F. was the U.S.’s closest ally in Syria for more than a decade. That alliance is now disintegrating as the U.S. throws its weight behind the new Syrian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli forces killed at least 11 people in Gaza, including three Palestinian journalists who the Israeli military said were flying a drone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan restarted a reactor at a large nuclear complex, nearly 15 years after the Fukushima meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince Harry became emotional as he testified in London’s High Court about what he called intrusive news coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Han Duck-soo, the former prime minister of South Korea, was sentenced to 23 years for collaborating with the imposition of martial law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artificial island has a gigantic shopping mall without shops, a theme park without visitors, high-rise housing blocks without residents and beaches too dangerous for swimming. My colleagues paid a visit to the project, a symbol of China’s never-ending real estate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

Alongside Americans, they shopped for Withersbrook Blue, a recent winner at the World Cheese Awards, and creamy Harbison, which has woodsy notes derived from its spruce-bark wrapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21int-greenland-reax01-photo-cqpb/21int-greenland-reax01-photo-cqpb-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Greenlanders and Danes expressed relief and even hope after President Trump suddenly signaled on Wednesday night that a solution had been reached with NATO that would avoid a confrontation over Greenland. But some Greenlandic politicians said it was wrong that they had not been involved in the talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his speech in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would not use force to acquire Greenland. Later he wrote in a post on social media that he had “a very productive meeting” with the head of NATO and “formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland has been part of the Danish Kingdom for more than 300 years and Danish commentators were buoyed by the developments even though the details about the deal had not been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks more promising than anything I have seen in weeks,” said Mikkel Runge Olesen, a researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies in Copenhagen.“It is certainly a decisive new development,” he said. “The Danish reactions right now are cautiously optimistic. I think people are holding back because of how quickly a seemingly positive development has come to nothing before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Aaja Chemnitz, one of the two Greenlandic members of the Danish parliament and a major political figure in Greenland, rejected what Mr. Trump said about the “future deal” with NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we are witnessing these days in statements from Trump is completely absurd,” she said in a post that appeared on Facebook. “NATO has absolutely no mandate to negotiate anything whatsoever without us in Greenland.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing about us, without us,” she said. “There is total confusion being created.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the speech earlier in the day at the World Economic Forum, Mr. Trump kept up his insistence that the United States should take over the island, and he provided a curious history lesson. He said that after the Germans invaded Denmark in 1940, the United States rushed in to defend Greenland. That part is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what isn’t was Mr. Trump’s insistence that after the war, the United States somehow “gave it back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not true at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark never relinquished sovereignty of the island, the largest in the world. Instead, the Danish ambassador in Washington, cut off from Copenhagen, took it upon himself to strike a defense agreement for Greenland that allowed American forces access to defend it. The expectation was that Denmark would regain control of the island after the war, which it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That initial agreement, made in 1941, paved the way for a sweeping Danish-American defense pact 10 years later that most analysts and European officials, especially the Danes, say is robust enough for Mr. Trump to accomplish his security goals. In his speech, he reiterated his argument that the only way to protect Greenland is for the United States to own it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talked about his plan for a “golden dome” missile defense program that would necessitate American control of Greenland. He even spent a little time explaining that Greenland’s glittering minerals, which he acknowledged were buried under “hundreds of feet of ice,” weren’t the real attraction, but that it was all about security, security, security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speech was carried live on TV in Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anso Lauritzen, the owner of sled dog center in western Greenland, said, “I couldn’t help myself — I had to watch.” Her impression was that the speech was headed in the right direction, at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But then he just keeps talking,” Ms. Lauritzen said about Mr. Trump. “We really don’t know what he’s thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to be part of America,” she added on Wednesday afternoon. “I don’t want to follow their rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by night, after reading Mr. Trump’s new comment, she said, “Is he acting alone? We’re trying to read all the media, but we can’t see what it’s about. What do you think they’ve agreed on? That’s all I want to know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark’s foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Wednesday that the day ended better than it began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This morning we had a president who would not rule out taking Greenland by force. Now he says he will not take Greenland by force,” Mr. Rasmussen told Danish television channel, TV 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rasmussen said he had spoken briefly with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and would receive a more detailed briefing on the meeting later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the conversation, the use of force is off the table, Mr. Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That creates a small sliver of hope,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland’s government said it would comment on Mr. Trump’s remarks on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuno Fencker, a member of the Greenlandic parliament who has been open to a closer relationship with the United States, said he was upset that all these talks were going on between Mr. Trump and NATO about Greenland but without Greenland’s input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenland should be directly involved in what is going on,” he said. “That is what we want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Gettleman and Amelia Nierenberg reported from London and Maya Tekeli from Copenhagen. Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting from London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21int-davos-scene01-photo-bqgm/21int-davos-scene01-photo-bqgm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As President Trump threatened to upend some of the central pillars of the Western order on Wednesday, during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, some in the crowd of elites sat speechless. Others groaned. A few gasped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president and a key power broker in Europe, stood up ashen-faced at the end of the speech that took aim at people like him: the leaders of the Western political and economic elite. As others made for the exits, Mr. Stubb approached Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina — seeking to learn more, Mr. Graham later said, about Mr. Trump and the United States’ position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everybody in Europe is concerned,” Mr. Graham, an ally of Mr. Trump, said dismissively after speaking to Mr. Stubb. “They’re concerned when they get up and when they go to bed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction from Mr. Stubb, who declined to comment, embodied a broader sense of shock across the conference, a talking shop for political and economic leaders. For decades, like-minded politicians, businesspeople, investors and celebrities have gathered in Davos to discuss a shared economic and political future. But for more than an hour on Wednesday in one of the main speaking halls, Mr. Trump transformed the forum into the setting of a dramatic rupture between the West’s leading player and its increasingly distant allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mocking European leaders for days, Mr. Trump flew thousands of miles to this snowy mountainside to launch into a verbal assault against the Western alliance, the values of its leaders and societies, and the framework of world trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day Mr. Trump had rescinded some of his worst threats, saying that he had reached a tentative framework with NATO over the future of Greenland, which he wants to buy from Denmark, and withdrawn threats to impose new tariffs on allies that opposed U.S. ownership of Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some European leaders expressed a glimmer of hope over the moves, they did little to salve the deep fear among Davos’s browbeaten guests that the United States could no longer be relied on as an ally. Earlier in the day the group had weathered insult after insult from Mr. Trump about their approach to trade, the environment and immigration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scattered chuckling fell to an anxious silence before turning into audible gasps as Mr. Trump used his speech to once again demand ownership of Greenland, lash out against NATO and vaguely threaten economic warfare if the European leaders did not acquiesce to his demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders sat stunned as Mr. Trump insulted their governments and questioned their reliability as allies. Others grimaced as Mr. Trump claimed the European nations and Canada owed the United States a debt. Some even scrambled after the speech to find and question current and former U.S. officials about the president’s thinking and the future of the United States as a trustworthy partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Gordon, a former national security adviser for Kamala Harris who attended the speech, said foreign officials approached him during the summit asking if Mr. Trump’s position was now “permanent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is this America?” Mr. Gordon said European officials asked him on Wednesday. “And is the post-World War II era definitively over — or is there any hope it comes back?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was also a growing acceptance that a new world order is now emerging, right under their noses at a conference that for years was so emblematic of the old frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They accept that under Trump this is a new world,” said Mr. Gordon. “No one can deny that and even the Europeans who have been in denial now accept.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his speech, Mr. Trump crystallized an idea central to that new world — a searing disregard for the post-World War II world order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump suggested the European allies owed him Greenland. He said that without the United States’ efforts in World War II, “you’d all be speaking German and a little Japanese perhaps,” prompting moans from the crowd. And while he said he would not use force to obtain Greenland — prompting some to breathe a sigh of relief — he did continued to frame Greenland as a debt that needed to be paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can say yes and we will be very appreciative or you can say no and we will remember,” Mr. Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump took particular aim at Switzerland, the country hosting the summit, stunning some Swiss officials. “They’re only good because of us,” Mr. Trump said of the Swiss as he celebrated his sweeping tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was really astonished,” said Elisabeth Schneider-Schneiter, a member of the Swiss Parliament. “We are the hosts, we are the guarantee for his security from the airport to Davos, with public tax money spent, and I was convinced that we had resolved the trade issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the attendees liked his speech or not — and many seemed to loathe it — Mr. Trump’s appearance was the talk of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the hall where Mr. Trump spoke, companies held watch parties to view his speech. Attendees tried to rearrange meetings in order not to miss it. On the promenade, people live streamed his remarks while walking, before others later recounted the bombshells in the speech. “Are we even important?” one asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet others spoke of a disaster averted, particularly after Mr. Trump said he was not interested in using force to acquire Greenland. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said he later encountered some European officials who told him “it could’ve been worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s remarkable when we’ve gotten to a place where we’re saying it could’ve been worse because an American president took off the table the use of force against a NATO ally,” Mr. Coons said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here and there, you could find warm support for the president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his speech, Mr. Trump spoke at a reception for business executives, financial chiefs and cryptocurrency leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We got great reviews,” Mr. Trump told the crowd. “I can’t believe it, but we got good reviews of that speech. Usually they say he’s a horrible dictator type person, but sometimes you need a dictator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes later, as Mr. Trump finished speaking, he was met with loud applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once Mr. Trump revoked some of his biggest threats on Wednesday evening, the mood across the conference edged closer to relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Mr. Trump’s decision to pull back on tariffs, some attendees texted their peers a single word: “Taco!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term is short for Trump Always Chickens Out, a tongue-in-cheek quip adopted by some critics to describe Mr. Trump’s tendency to threaten sweeping tariffs, only to pull them back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’ve lived through so many cycles of this,” Mr. Gordon said. “You live to fight another day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21dc-board-peace-mkft/21dc-board-peace-mkft-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the proposed charter of the “Board of Peace” that the United States sent to national capitals in recent weeks, one man has the power to veto decisions, approve the agenda, invite members, dissolve the board entirely and designate his own successor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name is spelled out in Article 3.2: “Donald J. Trump shall serve as inaugural chairman.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Trump, then peace,” Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, one of President Trump’s closest allies in Europe, wrote on Facebook on Sunday after Mr. Trump invited him to join the board. “We have, of course, accepted this honorable invitation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel, Belarus, Pakistan and several more countries also said they were joining, ahead of a signing ceremony planned for Thursday in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many officials and experts in international affairs were stunned by the breadth of the initiative, the latest example of Mr. Trump taking apart the American-built, post-World War II international system and building a new one, with himself at the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a direct assault on the United Nations,” said Marc Weller, a Cambridge international law professor who specializes in peace negotiations and has worked closely with the global body. “This initiative is likely to be seen as a takeover of the world order by one individual in his own image.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.N. Security Council itself endorsed the creation of a Board of Peace in November in a resolution welcoming the U.S.-brokered peace plan to end Israel’s war in Gaza. According to that resolution, the board is to function as a “transitional administration” through 2027 to oversee the redevelopment of Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in unveiling the Board of Peace in the last week, the Trump administration has cast Gaza as only a part of what the new institution would do. While its powers are not defined, its mission would overlap with the United Nations’ aim of maintaining international peace and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trump has proven himself a pretty capable and aggressive leader,” said Fred Fleitz, the chief of staff of the National Security Council for part of Mr. Trump’s first term. “This is taking advantage of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed charter, seen by The New York Times, says the board would seek to “secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s peace envoy, who was named as a member of the group’s “executive board,” told CNBC that more than 20 countries had already agreed to join and that the Board of Peace would be “a great group of leaders coming together” in “sharing opinion to achieve peace.” He listed Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Sudan and Syria as among the places in need of “bridging relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wish the United Nations could do more,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday. “I wish we didn’t need a Board of Peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he wanted the board to replace the United Nations, Mr. Trump said that it “might.” He added: “I believe you got to let the U.N. continue because the potential is so great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations itself has sought to play down any tensions. A spokesman, Farhan Haq, told reporters that the U.N. “has coexisted alongside any number of organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Trump administration’s ambiguous messaging about the Board of Peace has added to the head-spinning nature of an extraordinary January in American foreign policy. The U.S. attack on Venezuela, the threats of strikes on Iran and Mr. Trump’s demands to take over Greenland have all sent the message that the United States is seeking to exert its global power in a newly unilateral way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Peace, with its sprawling mission and with Mr. Trump as its long-term chairman, appeared to be an attempt at building an institution to codify the American dominance that the president envisions. Norway, Sweden and France have already said they do not intend to join. The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said his country would say “no to creating an organization as it has been presented, which would replace the United Nations,” according to The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The bond of trust has been broken” between the United States and its allies, said R. Nicholas Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, China and elsewhere. “The overreach by the administration on Greenland and the miscalculation they have made has really brought about a different European view and Canadian view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump withdrew from 66 international organizations that his administration deemed “wasteful, ineffective, and harmful.” He has suggested that he sees his board filling some of that vacuum — offering the world a more assertive brand of American engagement, personified by Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Peace “will be established as a new international organization,” Mr. Trump wrote in his letter to Mr. Orban, which the Hungarian prime minister posted online. The organization’s charter says in its opening line that “durable peace” requires “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Fleitz, who is now at the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank close to the administration, said the decision to include Russia and China among the invited members reflected the intended “broad-based” nature of the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They want to reduce the possibility that various countries will try to sabotage it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia and China have veto power on the U.N. Security Council, so they would be likely to look askance at any weakening of the body. But both have also tried to curry favor with Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has said it was invited but not whether it would accept. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also stopped short of accepting the invitation, saying his foreign ministry needed to analyze the matter. But in an example of how countries can try to use Mr. Trump’s ambitions to advance their own interests, Mr. Putin added that Russia was prepared to contribute $1 billion to the board — as long as the money comes out of the Russian assets that were frozen in the West after Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft charter for the board stipulates the $1 billion fee for countries that seek to stay on for longer than a three-year term. A U.S. official said on Tuesday that the board “will implement the highest financial controls and oversight mechanisms” for the cash it collects, and that “funds will sit only in approved accounts at reputable banks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. official confirmed that Mr. Trump could play a central role in the board even after leaving the presidency. Mr. Trump can hold the chairmanship “until he resigns it,” the official said. “A future U.S. president, however, may choose to appoint or designate the United States’ representative to the board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Weller, the peace negotiations specialist, argued that the expected $1 billion contributions could further sap funding from the U.N., whose agencies were told by the United States in December that they needed to “adapt, shrink or die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said that the central personal role envisioned for Mr. Trump was unlike any other agreement he had seen in his experience in international affairs. It was, he said, unlikely to represent a sustainable pathway to world peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Peace in the world requires a broad, international consensus,” Mr. Weller said. “That can hardly be created through a new institution that is entirely dependent on the will of one man.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21assad-hvmj/21assad-hvmj-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rifaat al-Assad, who as a paramilitary leader in 1982 put down an uprising against his brother, Syria’s ruler Hafez al-Assad, killing up to 40,000 and earning him the nickname “the butcher of Hama,” died on Monday. He was 88.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His death was reported by his son Siwar al-Assad on social media. Voice of Emirates, a news site in Dubai, where Mr. Assad had been living in exile, reported that he died there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than 50 years, many of them spent in cosseted exile, Rifaat al-Assad was an integral part of the family that ruled Syria with an iron fist — sometimes agitating from the inside for more power, and sometimes from the outside, as the leader of failed movements to gain dominance in his country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His notorious place in Syria’s history was assured by his command over the large-scale massacre of civilians in Hama in 1982, a model later followed by his nephew Bashar for effectively suppressing dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Assad was the commander of an elite unit, the paramilitary Defense Forces, when his brother sent him to crush an uprising in the west-central Syrian city of Hama in February 1982. Hama was in the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood, bitterly opposed to the secularist Ba’ath Party regime of Mr. Assad’s older brother Hafez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revolt, the most serious challenge Hafez faced during his harsh 30-year reign, was crushed with merciless brutality in a siege that lasted nearly a month.&lt;/p&gt;

We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rifaat al-Assad’s forces began an indiscriminate bombardment of residential neighborhoods in Hama on Feb. 2, deploying the Syrian Air Force and ground troops “without distinguishing between civilians and combatants,” according to a report by the Syrian Network for Human Rights on the massacre’s 40th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The regime forces carried out deliberate killings of wounded people, targeting entire families, including women, children and young people,” the report added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The massacre was covered up by the Hafez al-Assad regime, and no official death toll was ever established. It created the precedent for Bashar, who faced his own civilian uprising in 2011 and who scrupulously followed his uncle’s example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, with Rifaat al-Assad long since living a life of luxurious exile in Europe, Swiss prosecutors indicted him for war crimes and crimes against humanity, under their country’s broad remit to pursue international war criminals on the basis of individuals’ residence, however brief, in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the commander of operations at Hama, Mr. Assad “ordered murders, acts of torture, acts of cruelty, and illegal imprisonments,” the indictment stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He never faced a day in prison for commanding the Hama massacre, nor for illicitly accumulating a vast portfolio of sumptuous properties in Europe and the Caribbean with money stolen from the Syrian state, with an estimated value of more than $800 million. In addition to a palatial dwelling on Paris’s ultra-fashionable Avenue Foch, he and members of family owned villas on Spain’s Costa del Sol, a 110-acre estate outside Paris and a $15 million Georgian townhouse in the elegant Mayfair area of London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, a French court sentenced Rifaat al-Assad to four years in jail for “crimes of exceptional gravity,” related to his large-scale embezzlement, and ordered his properties to be seized. His nephew Bashar, taking pity on his uncle, allowed him to flee back to Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Assad’s visits back had been rare ever since his abortive attempt to overthrow his brother Hafez in March 1984, two years after the Hama massacre. Mr. Assad had helped his brother, a military officer, take power in 1970, but relations between the two had always been guarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizing his chance while his brother was ill in the winter of 1984, Rifaat deployed 55,000 members of his Defense Forces around Damascus, intent on acquiring power. They were confronted by troops loyal to Hafez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subsequent meeting of the two brothers, in the presence of their elderly mother, who was flown in from their native village for the occasion, defused the crisis. “Here I am. I am the regime,” Hafez reportedly said to his younger brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rifaat agreed to stand down in exchange for being designated “vice-president,” a title that turned out to be meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long period of comfortable exile began, first in Switzerland and then in France. In 1986, President François Mitterrand of France, convinced that Mr. Assad would one day succeed his brother, and wanting to keep him close — Syria had been a French protectorate before World War II — awarded him the Legion of Honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Hafez died in 2000, Rifaat asserted his right to succeed him but was rebuffed by Syria’s ruling Baathist party in favor of his 34-year-old nephew Bashar, who until then had been a relatively unobtrusive ophthalmologist. Rifaat was barred from attending his brother’s funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bashar fell with unexpected haste in 2024, Rifaat tried to escape Syria via a Russian air base in the country, but the Russian military there refused to allow him in. He fled to Lebanon, reportedly crossing a river on the back of an associate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rifaat al-Assad was born in the village of al-Qardaha, in western Syria, on Aug. 22, 1937, to a family of the Alawite minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He studied political science and economics at Damascus University, joined the military after the Ba’ath Party seized power in March 1963, and took command of the Defense Companies, which the publication Middle East Intelligence Bulletin called the “Praetorian Guards of the Assad regime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was as their leader that he first made his name in Syria, directing them in a massacre of Muslim Brotherhood inmates at the Tadmore prison in June 1980, in which 600 to 1,000 of them were killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete information on his survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Assad was known to have married four times, in polygamous marriages, lastly to Lina al-Khayyir. His children include his daughters Tumadir and Tamadhin and another son, Ribal al-Assad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His son Siwar, announcing his father’s death, denounced what he called “a flood of lies and calumnies” emanating from “detractors.”&lt;/p&gt;

Europe Must Decide What to Do About It.</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/europe/trump-rift-europe.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22int-europe-assess01-photo-gqmv/22int-europe-assess01-photo-gqmv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depth of the rift between President Trump and Europe was on full display on Wednesday as Mr. Trump delivered remarks in Davos, Switzerland, airing his disdain for Europe’s immigration policies, its regulations and its strident unwillingness to give him Greenland, which he insists America must own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, Europe has been looking to find a diplomatic answer to de-escalate the crisis. Hope for such an off ramp came late Wednesday, when Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social to announce that he and Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, were working on a deal that could resolve the dispute over Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. He suggested that tariffs he had previously threatened to impose on European nations starting Feb. 1 would no longer kick in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither he nor NATO provided any details of what such that framework might look like, and there is no guarantee that such a deal will be finished. A member of the Danish parliament from Greenland called the deal into question in a social media post, saying it had created “total confusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dust had not yet settled Wednesday night. But one thing was clear. Mr. Trump’s comments throughout the day underscored just how little the United States and Europe — long the closest of allies — now have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we may no longer be literally staring down the barrel of a gun on the trans-Atlantic relationship, we are still in a very rocky place,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are fundamentally at odds, in a way that can only reflect the very different values between most governments in Europe and the Trump administration,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders, many of them shocked by Mr. Trump’s threats to take over the sovereign territory of an E.U. member and NATO ally, must still come together on what they might or should do if Mr. Trump changes his position again — and about the trans-Atlantic relationship more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening, leaders from across the 27-nation European Union will gather in Brussels to discuss the perilous state of Europe’s relationship with the United States. They may discuss the contours of the plan Mr. Trump alluded to in his social media post. They will debate how they should approach this new and more hostile era, especially when Russia is still waging war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump had announced over the weekend that he intended to apply levies of 10 percent on several European nations that have recently sent troops to Greenland as part of a NATO exercise. Although he has suspended those tariffs, it is unclear if that will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mere possibility set off a panicked flurry. European ambassadors met for an emergency gathering on Sunday to discuss the development, and many European leaders called Mr. Trump directly. Thursday’s summit was called in response to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion is likely to touch on the state of play after the gathering in Davos, including Mr. Rutte’s discussion with Mr. Trump. Leaders will also vet what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the tariff issue is resolved, and even if the Greenland matter is resolved, Mr. Trump’s aggressive push for the island — and his language about Europe in recent days and weeks — have exposed a serious rupture forming between the partners that is far from healed. Europe is grappling with a changed reality, after decades in which it relied on a stable relationship with the United States for both trade and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The shift in the international order is not only seismic — but it is permanent,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said on Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior European official, speaking anonymously to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters, appealed for a bit of calm, noting that Mr. Trump recently threatened to sanction any country that did business with Iran, but has not done so until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson, he suggested, was to keep Europe’s powder dry, not to overreact and escalate needlessly with a key ally, and push for diplomacy. To that end, he said the bloc should be ready to retaliate — to have leverage — but should not react unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union already has a 93 billion euro, or $107 billion, list of U.S. goods prepared that it is poised to hit with retaliatory tariffs after Feb. 6. The list was finalized last year in response to Mr. Trump’s earlier trade war, and it will snap into place automatically unless E.U. officials take proactive moves to suspend it — making it a natural first step, should retaliation prove necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump also had his usual harsh words for NATO during his speech on Wednesday, asserting that NATO allies would not come to the aid of the United States if attacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the only time Article V of the NATO treaty, the commitment to collective defense, was ever invoked was to aid the United States after it was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NATO troops fought alongside American soldiers in Afghanistan for a decade, and Denmark itself had more soldiers die per capita in Afghanistan than America did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, at Davos, Mr. Rutte, the NATO secretary general, praised Mr. Trump for pushing member states to spend more on their own defense, which has strengthened the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked if he could imagine NATO without the United States, he said simply, “No.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States “is by far the most powerful nation on earth, and the president of the United States is the leader of the free world,” he said, adding, “And you cannot envision NATO without the leader of the free world being an integral part of that organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rutte also touched on the most pressing security issue for Europeans, which is Russian aggression against Ukraine — right on the E.U.’s borders — and not an icy island in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The risk here is that we focus, of course, on Greenland, because we have to make sure that issue gets solved in an amicable way,” Mr. Rutte said on a panel in Davos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ukraine should be our No. 1 priority, and then we can discuss all the issues, including Greenland,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/22/multimedia/20int-mexico-trump-1/20int-mexico-trump-1-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico sent 37 people accused of being criminal operatives to the United States on Tuesday, the latest apparent bid to alleviate pressure from President Trump to do more to combat the powerful groups smuggling drugs across the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first such transfer this year, when Mr. Trump’s threats of military action against Mexico have grown more direct, but the third since he took office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexican authorities have now sent nearly 100 people accused of being key criminals to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transfers are part of a larger effort by Mexican authorities to appease Mr. Trump as he threatens unilateral strikes inside Mexican territory — an act that Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum has said would be a violation of her nation’s sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid those threats, Ms. Sheinbaum has launched an aggressive campaign against cartels, strengthened policing at the border, bent to Mr. Trump’s economic demands and sent dozens of accused criminals north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many experts in Mexico have raised questions about the legal grounds and political gambit of the transfers, as they have been completed outside the normal extradition process. Omar García Harfuch, Mexico’s security chief, said Tuesday that the transfers were legal and that, in agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, the death penalty would not be pursued. (Capital punishment is prohibited in Mexico.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These individuals posed a real threat to the country’s security,” he posted online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Harfuch added that the detainees were sent to various U.S. cities on Mexican military planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a year, Mr. Trump has threatened military measures and tariffs to try to force Mexican officials to take more action against cartels and illegal immigration. In the aftermath of the U.S. strike in Venezuela, Mr. Trump’s threats have grown sterner. He said in a Fox News interview on Jan. 8 that the United States would “start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels” in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those comments greatly concerned Mexicans officials, who had believed that the two countries’ deep economic ties and improved security cooperation would shield Mexico from unilateral action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, The New York Times reported that the United States was intensifying pressure on Mexico to allow U.S. military forces to conduct joint operations to dismantle fentanyl labs inside the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Sheinbaum and Mr. Trump spoke briefly on Jan. 12. Even though she said that she again rejected Mr. Trump’s offer of U.S. troops in Mexico, she said they agreed to talk more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But late last week, despite a phone call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Mexican counterpart and a joint statement about upcoming security meetings, the State Department said in a social media post that “the United States made clear that incremental progress in facing border security challenges is unacceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Ms. Sheinbaum defended her country’s efforts, sharing data that she said underscored her administration’s progress in fighting drug trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that the United States needed to better tackle the drug trade within its own borders, as well as the flow of guns into Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Mr. Trump’s comments about land strikes in Mexico, Mexican officials have wanted to show results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They announced arrests of people they accused of being part of criminal groups that the Trump administration has designated as foreign terrorist organizations. They touted raids of drug labs and drug seizures, including what they said was $20 million worth of fentanyl smuggled into Mexico City’s airport as cosmetics from Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Mexican officials said they arrested, with help from the F.B.I., a fugitive named Alejandro Rosales Castillo, who had been on the U.S. agency’s Top Ten Most Wanted list since 2017 for murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, Mexican authorities have handed over 92 “high-impact criminals,” in Mr. Harfuch’s words, since Mr. Trump took office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether the accused criminals had been convicted of offenses in Mexico or were being held awaiting trial. Mexican officials linked many to cartels, saying they had trafficked drugs and laundered money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the detainees transferred to the United States, according to the Mexican government: Daniel Alfredo Blanco Joo, accused by Mexican authorities of being a logistics operator linked to the Sinaloa Cartel who helped smuggle drugs into the United States; José Luis Sánchez Valencia, whom Mexican officials said was part of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel and related to its leader; and Ricardo González Sauceda, who is accused of being a regional leader of the Cártel del Noreste and was sanctioned by the U.S. in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s an offering,” said Carlos Pérez Ricart, an expert on organized crime and professor at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest handover, he said, is “far from a magic solution” to stave off Mr. Trump’s pressure. “But at least the Mexican government is buying itself some time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Pérez Ricart said that the legal and political debate surrounding the transfers have subsided since the first one last year, in part, because of Mr. Trump’s military action in Venezuela has made his threats more real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21int-uk-harry-pktw/21int-uk-harry-pktw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince Harry became visibly emotional on Wednesday as he testified in London’s High Court about the effects of what he called intrusive news coverage on his life and that of his wife, Meghan Markle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry was giving evidence in his case against Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the British tabloids The Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday. He and six other high-profile figures, including Elton John, have accused the company of phone hacking, obtaining personal records through deception and other forms of unlawful information gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associated Newspapers has denied all the accusations, saying its articles about Harry were the result of legitimate journalistic work and the prince’s “leaky” social circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry said in court that his yearslong legal battle with the company had been a “horrible experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They continue coming after me; they have made my wife’s life an absolute misery,” he said, his voice cracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The articles at the center of the case, published between 2001 and 2013, reported intimate details of Harry’s romantic relationships, his social activities and his feelings about his mother’s death. He said reading them had been a “recurring traumatic experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He accused the news media of “commercializing” his life since his childhood and “delving into every single aspect of my private life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry is the first well-known figure in the case to give evidence in the trial, which is scheduled to last more than two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a written witness statement filed with the court, Harry said that the death of his mother, Princess Diana, while being chased by paparazzi in 1997 meant he had always had an “uneasy relationship” with the press, but that he was “conditioned to accept” constant coverage because of his role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the royal family had a policy of “never complain, never explain” over inaccurate and invasive articles which he became “increasingly troubled by” after his relationship with Ms. Markle began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry accused Associated Newspapers journalists, and private investigators acting on their behalf, of hacking his voice mail messages, tapping landline phone calls, “blagging” records — getting them through deception — and obtaining phone bills and private flight information. “Whenever I got on a plane, or in a car, I always expected I was being followed,” he said. “I was under 24-hour surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue for the High Court to decide is whether — on the “balance of probabilities” — the specific articles in question were the product of unlawful information gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In written arguments presented to the court, lawyers representing Associated Newspapers said that the social circles around Harry and the other claimants “were ‘leaky’” and that their friends and associates “did regularly provide information to the press.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s lawyer Anthony White repeatedly asked Harry on Wednesday if it was possible that his associates had communicated with journalists at parties and other social occasions. Mr. White said the newspapers had obtained information from legitimate sources and reporting practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry denied that his friends were the source of the articles and accused journalists of “making up quotes to create a narrative and disguise the true source of information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He challenged the basis of Mr. White’s questions during a series of tense exchanges and was gently reprimanded by Judge Matthew Nicklin for “arguing the case” rather than answering questions in his role as a witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You tend to argue back to the barrister about what he is putting to you,” Judge Nicklin said. “Your role is simply to answer the questions as best as you can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said the evidence that Harry contested would be examined at a later stage of the trial, during questioning of witnesses including the journalists who wrote the articles and private investigators who worked for Associated Newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry’s claim relates to 14 articles published in The Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday, which he argues were the product of unlawful information gathering. One, published in July 2006 under the headline “LET HER REST IN PEACE,” contained details of what the prince said were “confidential discussions” with his brother, Prince William, about the publication of a photograph of their dying mother in the Italian media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another article, published earlier that year, revealed details about Harry’s relationship with his girlfriend then, Chelsy Davy, and her feelings about his joining the British Army. The prince argued that those details, including that he had called Ms. Davy “from a shop when choosing a costume outfit” could have come only from phone tapping. In his written statement, Harry said the article put “massive strain” on their relationship and created “paranoia and distrust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is one of several legal battles that Harry has pursued since 2020, when he and his wife stepped down from their royal roles and left Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of The Daily Mirror, another tabloid, settled a claim over phone hacking in February 2024. Last January Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers agreed to pay “substantial” damages to Harry and admitted for the first time to unlawful activities by private investigators working for The Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military began transferring Islamic State prisoners from northeastern Syria to Iraq on Wednesday, amid growing concern that thousands of former fighters and their family members could escape from detention as the Syrian government and Kurdish-led forces vie for control of the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East, said in a statement that American forces had already transported 150 fighters for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, from a detention facility in northeastern Syria to an unspecified “secure location in Iraq.” The military said as many as 7,000 detainees could ultimately be moved from Syrian custody to Iraqi-run facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are closely coordinating with regional partners, including the Iraqi government, and we sincerely appreciate their role in ensuring the enduring defeat of ISIS,” said Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of U.S. military forces in the Middle East. “Facilitating the orderly and secure transfer of ISIS detainees is critical to preventing a breakout that would pose a direct threat to the United States and regional security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transfer effort reflected growing concern about the security of detention sites in northeastern Syria, which for years have been guarded by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F. The group has come under assault over the past week during a lightning offensive by Syrian government troops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over the past two days, fresh bouts of violence have erupted around prisons holding Islamic State detainees as Kurdish forces withdrew and Syrian government forces moved in. As many as 200 detainees escaped from one of those prisons, al-Shaddadi, according to a U.S. military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The turmoil stoked fears among U.S. and regional officials of a wider prison break in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a fragile cease-fire, the S.D.F. has agreed to relinquish control of prisons and other critical infrastructure as part of a long-awaited deal to integrate Kurdish-held regions into the Syrian state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Washington’s public support for Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, the move appeared to underscore lingering doubts in Washington over the government’s ability to ensure security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the transfers were being carried out urgently, over days rather than weeks, amid concerns about whether Syrian government forces could safely manage the detainees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the S.D.F. was Washington’s chief ally in Syria, backed by U.S. air power, funding and intelligence as the Kurdish-led militia steered the ground fight against the Islamic State. But on Tuesday, the U.S. special envoy to Syria, Thomas J. Barrack Jr., indicated that Washington no longer needed the group in that role, marking a major shift in American policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22int-gaza-journalists-photo-fmcv/22int-gaza-journalists-photo-fmcv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli forces killed at least 11 people in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, Gaza health officials said, including three Palestinian journalists who the Israeli military said were flying a drone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, a labor union, said the three men were documenting the “suffering of civilians in displacement camps.” The Israeli military said they were operating a drone that was “affiliated with Hamas” and that its forces believed it posed a threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli military said the details of the incident were under examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three journalists were identified as Abdel Raouf Shaath, Mohammad Salah Qishta and Anas Ghneim by the journalists’ union. One of those journalists, Mr. Shaath, had been a regular freelancer for the French newswire Agence France-Presse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian Relief Committee, a state-backed group providing aid in the Gaza Strip, said in a statement that Mr. Qishta had been documenting the organization’s relief efforts. The journalists’ union said they had been driving a car in the central town of Al-Zahra when the three journalists were targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Egyptian Commitee began housing residents in a shelter there as part of a plan to support displaced people in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gazan airspace is under the complete control of the Israeli military, which closely tracks even commercial drones that lift off in the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday’s killings were the latest in what has been an extremely deadly conflict for Palestinian journalists in Gaza. Israel has barred foreign journalists throughout the war and continues to do so three months into its cease-fire with Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of early January, the Committee to Project Journalists reported that Israeli forces had killed at least 206 journalists and media workers in Gaza since the start of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International law says journalists, like all civilians during war, cannot be considered military targets if they are conducting independent reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times during the conflict, the Israeli military has deliberately attacked and killed Palestinian reporters it accused of belonging to Hamas’s armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades. Several were employees of Al Jazeera, the Qatari-owned broadcaster, which called the allegations baseless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called an Israeli strike that killed five journalists at a Gaza hospital a “tragic mishap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/10/multimedia/00int-taiwan-politics-qvcp/00int-taiwan-politics-qvcp-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A political quagmire in Taiwan has stalled plans by its President Lai Ching-te to sharply increase military spending, even as President Donald Trump has pressed the island to pay more for its own defense against China’s campaign to bring the island under its control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition lawmakers who dominate the legislature have blocked Mr. Lai’s ambitious proposal to spend $40 billion across eight years on military equipment from moving forward without concessions from Mr. Lai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Taiwan, the impasse has implications beyond just a domestic political fight. It could raise questions about Taiwan’s ability to strengthen its defenses at a time when Mr. Trump is urging America’s allies and partners to shoulder more of the burden for their own security. Mr. Lai has pledged to lift military and security outlays to more than 3 percent of Taiwan’s economy this year to mollify the United States, the island’s chief security backer against Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Lai’s plan is caught in a tangle of budgetary and legal disputes between his party and the opposition parties. Both sides have used hardball tactics and accused each other of acting unlawfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking with longstanding practice, Mr. Lai’s premier refused to sign off on a law passed by the opposition-controlled legislature that would shift some tax revenues from the central government to local administrations. Opposition lawmakers, in turn, denounced the premier’s move to stymie the revenue law as unconstitutional. They have also called Mr. Lai a dictator and moved to impeach him, an effort that is largely symbolic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have never experienced such a massive crisis of constitutional rule of law as we have right now,” Weng Hsiao-ling, a lawmaker from the Nationalist Party, the main opposition party, said in an interview. “Executive power is not operating according to the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of Mr. Lai’s Democratic Progressive Party, for their part, say that the opposition is trying to paralyze his administration. They accuse some opposition politicians of taking their cues from Beijing and of endangering Taiwan’s security by holding up defense spending. They are frustrated that the opposition has twice rejected Mr. Lai’s nominations to Taiwan’s constitutional court, effectively sidelining the body that could help defuse such disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Su Chiao-hui, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive Party, said that the opposition’s blocking of nominees damaged Taiwan’s ability to resolve conflicts. “They changed the rules, and the referee is gone,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The friction reflects growing divisions in Taiwan over whether to hold tight to its relationship with the United States or try rapprochement with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lai’s party says that Taiwan is its own country, and stronger defense and deeper ties with the United States are the way to protect Taiwan against China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nationalist Party, however, favors expanded ties with Beijing. Some of its leaders, including its chairwoman, Cheng Li-wun, have suggested that Mr. Lai’s strategy will escalate tensions with China. They have said that they generally support military spending to protect Taiwan, but have emphasized their skepticism about Mr. Lai’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s an increasingly clear partisan divide of perception in Taiwan in terms of views of the U.S., views of China,” said Wei-ting Yen, a political scientist at Academia Sinica, a Taiwanese research academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions between the two sides grew last year after Mr. Lai’s party backed a recall campaign to oust dozens of Nationalist Party legislators, which ultimately failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationalist lawmakers are not in a “terribly good mood to make further compromises with Lai,” said Alexander C. Huang, an international security expert who was formerly that party’s director of international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition lawmakers have blocked deliberations on Mr. Lai’s military spending plan, as well as the annual budget, demanding, among other things, that Mr. Lai first appear before the legislature for questioning. The opposition has also pointed to what it says are unacceptably long delays in deliveries of U.S. weapons, including F-16 fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve paid up, but the weapons are nowhere to be seen,” Fu Kun-chi, a Nationalist Party leader, said last month. “We support national defense, but don’t support being fleeced in arms purchases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compromise may still be possible. The Nationalists have pushed for more public disclosure of details; the government has said that revealing some details would compromise security, but gave lawmakers a private briefing this week and released more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. representative in Taipei, Raymond Greene, has backed Mr. Lai’s military spending proposals and urged the parties to work together, while the State Department pledged to work with industry to deliver equipment more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some officials from Taiwan’s governing party hope that lawmakers from a smaller opposition party, the Taiwan People’s Party, will break with the Nationalists, giving Mr. Lai the votes to pass his plans. He appears buoyed after Taiwan and Washington signed a framework agreement to reduce Mr. Trump’s tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington may increase pressure on the opposition, aware that a public breach with the United States would be politically fraught for any party in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The opposition Nationalists naturally hope to keep a balance between China and the U.S.,” said Su Tzu-chiao, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taipei, “but they cannot directly oppose the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21int-Syria-Kurds-01-bpgv/21int-Syria-Kurds-01-bpgv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, they were the United States’ closest allies in Syria, fighting against the Islamic State, guarding American bases and running internment camps and prisons that held tens of thousands of jihadists and their relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That alliance is now disintegrating. The United States has turned away from its longtime allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., and thrown its support behind the new government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without U.S. backing, the S.D.F., a Kurdish-led force, has wobbled and beaten a retreat as the government moves troops into northeastern Syria to seize control, ending a standoff that has endured since President al-Sharaa took power in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the S.D.F. marks a turning point in Syria’s political transition after the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad and now paves the way for the government to take over the strategic region, its oil fields and rich agricultural lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pivot by Washington is a huge win for Mr. al-Sharaa, who has struggled to pull the country back together, as well as for Turkey, which vehemently opposed American support for the S.D.F. and backed Mr. al-Sharaa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the S.D.F. and its supporters, including U.S. officials who worked closely with the group, it feels like a betrayal of those who fought loyally alongside the United States and lost many thousands of combatants in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bleakness of the S.D.F. position was laid out by Ilham Ahmed, a senior leader of the Kurdish-led civilian administration in northeastern Syria, when she appealed at a news conference last week for the United States to stop playing both sides and to take a clear position to stop an offensive against its positions by Syrian government forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there is no reaction it is easy to presume they gave a green light,” she said of the American position on the government offensive. “They should take a clear stance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Ahmed also appealed for wider international support to enforce a cease-fire and support the political demands of the Kurdish administration. But she said that Arab states supported the al-Sharaa government and that reactions from European countries had been weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The entire world owes these troops who fought against ISIS,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S.D.F. was born following the terrifying rise of the Islamic State, which took over a swath of territory straddling the Syria-Iraq border in 2013 and built a so-called caliphate on a harsh interpretation of Islamic law and sheer brutality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking a way to fight the group without putting American troops on the front lines, the United States partnered with a Kurdish militia. It air dropped weapons to help break the siege of the Kurdish town of Kobani in 2014, and the partnership expanded from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the U.S., it made sense. The fighters were well trained, not Islamist, and eager to work with American troops. In time, with U.S. financial and military support, they grew, added Arab fighters and rebranded themselves as the Syrian Democratic Forces (although there was very little about them that was actually democratic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With logistical and air support from the United States and others, the S.D.F. destroyed the ISIS caliphate, pushing the group from its last patch of territory in Syria in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It continued to work with the United States to prevent the resurgence of ISIS and provide security across northeastern Syria with a force of tens of thousands of men and women under arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That alliance angered Turkey, who saw the group as no more than an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, a Kurdish militant group that has fought a bloody, 30-year insurgency against the Turkish state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also angered Syrian rebel groups and activists for imposing Kurdish rule over Arab-majority areas and doing its own deals with the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rebel offensive that toppled the Assad regime in December 2024, changed the paradigm for the Kurds. The United States established close ties with Mr. al-Sharaa and sought to bring the two groups to work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. ambassador to Turkey and envoy for Syria, Thomas J. Barrack Jr., led the negotiations and secured an agreement between Mr. al-Sharaa and the Kurdish leader of the S.D.F., Mazloum Abdi, in March last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those negotiations stalled and missed the deadline for S.D.F. to integrate its armed units and administration into the Damascus government by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. al-Sharaa complained that the Kurdish side kept augmenting its demands while making no move to withdraw from Arab-majority areas. The Kurdish leaders said they were holding out for security guarantees for their people in light of sectarian killings elsewhere in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end Mr. al-Sharaa lost patience and moved to seize control of two Kurdish-held neighborhoods in the city of Aleppo. From there Syrian forces moved rapidly, securing two large provincial capitals of Raqqa and Deir al-Zour in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newaf Xelil, an analyst at the Berlin-based Kurdish Center for Studies, said the swift advance of Mr. al-Sharaa’s forces in recent weeks had been enabled by the full embrace of his government by Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has baffled many in the S.D.F., he said, who still distrust Mr. al-Sharaa and many of his fighters for their past links to Islamic militancy and jihadism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. al-Sharaa was sent to Syria from Iraq more than a decade ago by the leader of the Islamic State, where he founded a Qaeda-affiliated rebel group. He later broke with Al Qaeda but has never fully renounced the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kurds, given their more secular outlook, could help dilute the Islamist character of Syria’s new government, Mr. Xelil said, a goal many thought that the United States shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We thought that they wanted Syria to become a normal government with an army not made up of jihadists,” he said, adding that it could have helped Syria reconcile with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fighting in recent days could complicate the merger of S.D.F. fighters into the new security forces, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He criticized Mr. Barrack, the U.S. envoy, for his full-throated support for Damascus. Mr. Barrack wrote on social media on Tuesday that the S.D.F.’s role had “expired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kurds had hugely miscalculated, Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, wrote in a WhatsApp message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the U.S. has never promised a Catholic marriage to the S.D.F., there was a sense that the relationship would continue and seamlessly merge into a more decentralized Syrian structure. All of that planning is now meaningless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump showed his ambivalence to the Kurdish position in comments to the media on Tuesday, while he commended Mr. al-Sharaa’s efforts to control the situation and secure prisons where thousands of ISIS members are detained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is working very hard, the president of Syria,” Mr. Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I spoke with him yesterday because we were talking about the prisons, and what was going on. We have some of the worst terrorists in the world in those prisons, and he is watching it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. Central Command announced Wednesday that it had transported 150 ISIS fighters detained in the city of Hasakah to a facility in Iraq, to prevent a breakout, a sign of growing security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump said the U.S. was also working to protect the Kurds. “I like the Kurds,” he said. “But just so you understand, the Kurds were paid tremendous amounts of money, given oil and other things, so they were doing it for themselves more than they were doing this for us. But we got along with the Kurds and we are trying to protect the Kurds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/00int-latam-response01a-photo-kgqm/00int-latam-response01a-photo-kgqm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, dormant high school group chats roared to life with news of Nicolás Maduro’s capture. Colombians debated exit plans if they were next on Washington’s list, Ecuadorean schoolteachers paused lessons to discuss the U.S. raid, and a Peruvian beauty queen even weighed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this regional frenzy did not translate into a significant wave of organized protests across a continent that has long harbored resentment over the United States’ Cold War-era meddling in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some Latin Americans denounced what they decried as American imperialism in Venezuela, a more supportive response to President Trump’s action prevailed, with several polls showing that a majority of Latin Americans endorsed the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am happy because I saw the fall of a dictator and I am happy because my Venezuelan friends are happy,” said Carlos Segura, 36, a professor in Buenos Aires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-four percent of Peruvians, sixty-three percent of Chileans, a majority of Colombians, Brazilians, Argentines, and even Panamanians, whose country was itself invaded by the United States to remove an authoritarian leader nearly three decades ago, approved of the capture, according to several polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mexico, the response was more evenly split, reflecting a significant leftist base and widespread opposition to Mr. Trump’s policies. The country’s leftist leader, Claudia Sheinbaum, issued a carefully worded rejection of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, disagreements among regional leaders over the U.S. removal of Mr. Maduro were tempered by a desire to avoid direct friction with Mr. Trump. And at the ground level, divisions among Latin Americans were softened by the left’s struggle to mobilize against the capture of a reviled authoritarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever unhappiness exists toward Mr. Trump and his desire to project dominance over Latin America, a shift toward pragmatism is eclipsing old ideological loyalties, at least for now, experts said. That could certainly change if Mr. Trump follows through on threats to launch land strikes, perhaps in Mexico or in South America, targeting what he says are drug cartels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the case of Venezuela, many Latin Americans opposed Mr. Maduro’s rule and felt the impact of its fallout — including millions of Venezuelans who migrated throughout the region fleeing poverty and repression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“International law, imperialism, this is the discourse of the elite,” said Marta Lagos, the founder of Latinobarómetro, an annual public opinion survey across Latin America. Popular support for the U.S. intervention, “has nothing to do with ideology,” she said. “They choose whatever is possible to fix things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of Venezuela’s political future is in flux, with the interim government run by those who ruled alongside Mr. Maduro, and their repressive behavior has continued targeting people engaged in public displays of celebration over the U.S. intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But outside the country, a resounding wave of euphoria rang out, louder than the traditional “Yankees go home” cries, as many Latin Americans joined the Venezuelan diaspora in welcoming Mr. Maduro’s toppling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was the only way Venezuelans could get rid of this guy,” said Lorena Plaza, 37, a schoolteacher in Quito, Ecuador. “Maybe it wasn’t the right way, but there really wasn’t another way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, where the Venezuelan crisis has been a fixture of domestic political friction for more than a decade as a cautionary lesson of socialist misrule, car horns erupted at dawn on Jan. 3 after news of Mr. Maduro’s capture spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An A.I. generated song by a Venezuelan living in Argentina that mocks how China and Russia failed to defend their Venezuelan ally — “where are the communists?” — became a major sensation, gathering more than 11 million views on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Panamanians and Venezuelans celebrating from now on every Jan. 3,” read a post from El Gallinazo, a popular Panamanian Instagram account that featured a video of two men dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some regional reactions to Mr. Maduro’s extraction still fell along familiar left-right divides. Many supporters of Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist, and Mexico’s Ms. Sheinbaum, opposed the U.S. attack. In Chile, President Gabriel Boric — who has tried to stake out a new brand of leftist politics by distancing himself from the region’s socialist dictatorships — nonetheless issued a sharply worded condemnation of the American action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Mr. Roman said, “you don’t really see the left rallying behind this as a major crying call.” Mr. Maduro’s rule proved so plainly calamitous, he added “it’s not an easy topic for the left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 3, while celebrations erupted in the heart of Buenos Aires, Argentina’s capital, leftist parties called for a protest outside the city’s U.S. Embassy — but the demonstration ended up being relatively modest in size. A survey by the polling firm Altica showed that 31 percent of Argentines opposed the U.S. intervention, while 61 percent supported it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentiment was largely different in Europe, where a majority of Spaniards, Germans and Britons condemned the attack, according to recent polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Argentina, a Gallup International survey found, registered the highest level of opposition of any country surveyed — 83 percent — with many Latin American nations also strongly criticizing the military action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Iraq was much closer in time to the Cold War, as well as a faraway geographical conflict, experts noted, while Venezuela was an immediate, nearby, destabilizing threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maduro turned out to be the neighbor who is noisy and disruptive, so when the police came to pick him up they were like: ‘finally,’” said Patricio Navia, a Chilean political scientist at New York University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard University, noted that three decades have passed since the Cold War helped contribute to U.S. meddling in Central America and a support for brutal dictatorships that entrenched anti-American sentiments across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There has been a pretty big generational change,” he said. “Many Latin Americans don’t remember that period.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Latin Americans now are worried about more pressing and urgent concerns, experts said, including crime waves fueled in large part by the power and spread of drug trafficking groups that have plagued countries like Ecuador or Costa Rica, nations that had been considered relatively safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Latin Americans are willing to embrace virtually any solution to end the violence, regardless of the methods employed. That “by all means necessary” logic can take the form of endorsing the illiberal methods of El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, who has suspended key civil liberties while cracking down on crime — but also of condoning outside intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Latin Americans don’t like a U.S. invasion,” Mr. Navia said, “but they dislike economic crises and humanitarian crises even more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela has been in crisis since 2014, when oil prices plunged, with food and medicine becoming scarcer and more expensive and the Maduro government becoming increasingly repressive, propelling one of the largest migration crises in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the eight million Venezuelans who fled the country in recent years, nearly seven million migrated to Latin American countries, most to Colombia and Perú, according to the Migration Policy institute, a research center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some nations, the influx has stretched budgets and angered locals who view the newcomers as competition for jobs and other services. And even though people who have committed crimes are a tiny fraction of the many Venezuelans who have fled, the infiltration of criminal gangs among the migrants have brought new crimes and fears among local populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Colombians saw in Mr. Maduro’s government an ally of armed Colombian rebel groups that have long terrorized their country. One of the largest has established a deep footprint along the border between Colombia and Venezuela, fomenting violence and displacing many Colombians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any action that could potentially weaken these groups is often welcomed by many Colombians — even if it means the United States raiding a sovereign country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are willing to look at El Salvador,” Ms. Lagos said. “People are willing to pay a price.”&lt;/p&gt;
