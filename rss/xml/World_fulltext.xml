&lt;p&gt;The big news in the United States over the weekend was the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old American citizen in Minneapolis by federal agents. Alex Pretti was the second civilian to be killed this month during an aggressive immigration crackdown. Videos show he was restrained when he was shot. Trump administration officials have rushed to smear him as a terrorist. We have the latest coverage of the developing story below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, I spoke with A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times, about threats to press freedom from the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second time this month, federal agents shot and killed a civilian in Minneapolis, and then blocked access to the scene. Here’s the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim, a 37-year-old man named Alex Pretti, was filming on his phone and trying to help a fellow protester on Saturday morning when several agents wrestled him to the ground and restrained him. Then they shot him multiple times. You can watch what happened here. (A warning that it’s disturbing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration claimed that Pretti, a nurse at the city’s veterans hospital, had approached the federal agents with a handgun and the intent to “massacre” them. But eyewitness video footage quickly emerged indicating that Pretti never drew his concealed pistol, and had already been disarmed when he was killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His death prompted large protests across the U.S., and led to a remarkable clash: Federal authorities have blocked state and local investigators from the crime scene. A judge issued a late-night order barring federal officials from destroying evidence, as the Trump administration repeated baseless accusations against the victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretti was a U.S. citizen with no known criminal record who held a legal permit to carry a firearm. Neighbors and colleagues at the hospital described him as passionate and kindhearted. The Minneapolis chief of police, Brian O’Hara, said Pretti had appeared to be “exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity, and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More from Minneapolis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This timeline shows how the shooting unfolded in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague Charles Homans has spent the past 10 days in his native city covering what he calls “the great American unraveling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events like the shooting in Minneapolis, in which eyewitness video and independent reporting contradict the government’s account, only highlight the importance of press freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the F.B.I. searched the home of a Washington Post reporter and seized her phone, laptops and other devices. We’re used to reading about governments going after journalists in places like China, Russia or Turkey. This took place in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job of journalists is to hold the powerful to account on behalf of the public. That job is becoming harder. The economics of journalism have been tough for a couple of decades. But the most immediate threat comes from attacks on press freedom by the U.S. government and the president himself. The New York Times has been the target of multiple lawsuits from President Trump over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to the man who has been leading The Times through this new era: our publisher, A.G. Sulzberger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.G., U.S. press freedom is under attack from the Trump administration. Talk me through its playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First Amendment of the American Constitution offers the press some of the most robust protections in the world. The architects of the Constitution understood that a healthy democracy depends on an informed public, and an informed public depends on a free press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In defiance of that ideal, which has long enjoyed bipartisan support, President Trump has borrowed many of the anti-press tactics used by authoritarian-minded leaders abroad. He has spent years attacking journalists and news organizations. He has sued a number of U.S. news organizations, including The New York Times, and has extracted large financial settlements from some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His administration has aggressively used other levers of power — from access to the Pentagon to regulatory and investigative oversight — to punish news organizations for writing things they don’t like, or reward those willing to parrot administration talking points. Sadly, there is growing evidence that, in response to this pressure, certain news organizations have, at times, self-censored for fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do these attacks compare with past administrations coming after The New York Times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has been far more aggressive in working to undermine the rights and legitimacy of the press than his recent predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But every president has complaints about the people covering their administrations. Kennedy tried to get The Times to reassign our reporter in Vietnam because he was revealing how badly the war was going. Bush warned us that if we exposed his campaign of illegal wiretapping on Americans we’d have blood on our hands. Biden was so incensed with our coverage, including our reporting on questions about his age and fitness, that he became the first president in close to a century not to do a single interview with The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson from all of those examples is clear: We must continue reporting the facts and bringing what we find to the public, regardless of what pressure we might face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Times reporters already do journalism in many countries where press freedoms have been gutted or were never established. Does that help us now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world as a whole has gotten much less hospitable to independent reporting. There are a growing number of places where journalists face arrest or violence for writing pieces that challenge the government. Russia, China and Iran are the most obvious examples. Israel has killed a huge number of Palestinian journalists in Gaza and banned foreign journalists from operating freely there for more than two years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our view is that the story of those places needs to continue to be told, no matter the obstacles. So that means our reporters must work harder to find new ways to keep reporting in the face of limited access, increased surveillance and more fearful sources. And The Times must spend more on legal and security support than ever, nearly 10 times as much as a decade ago. Are those approaches for operating in more hostile environments proving useful in the United States now? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media is very unpopular. Trump is using that. What have we done badly? What could we do better to win back trust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it’s worth remembering that the vast majority of Americans still believe that a free press is important. That said, it is true that journalists will inevitably make mistakes or miss things. But our core commitment is that when we make mistakes we acknowledge them, correct them and learn from them. When we miss things, we go back to the story and dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spend an inordinate amount of time at The Times asking what we could have done differently or better. That instinct toward reflection, transparency and self-correction is to me the most important ingredient in trust. Another is bringing readers a clearer view of how our work happens and why we make certain choices — which we’re trying to do more often with reporter videos and round tables, Times Insider pieces and Q&amp;As like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re under attack, is there a danger that you become part of the polarization? That you are seen as some kind of opposition or resistance? How do you think about navigating this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not anyone’s opposition or resistance — just as we’re not anyone’s supporter or cheerleader. We’re independent. As journalists we have to focus on presenting the fullest, fairest picture of what’s happening and why it matters, and that means tuning out both jeers and cheers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of press organizations have paid Trump huge settlements in weak lawsuits. The New York Times hasn’t. Are there lessons in standing up to Trump?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has filed three lawsuits against us in my tenure, and the only check that has been sent as a result was from the president to The Times: He was ordered to repay our lawyers’ fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your rights will only hold if you exercise them. And retreating in the face of pressure just emboldens future attacks and abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China ousted its top general, escalating a purge of the military elite that one analyst described as “the total annihilation of the high command.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace talks among Russian, Ukrainian and U.S. officials ended on a rare positive note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump threatened Canada with steep tariffs if it “makes a deal with China,” deepening his feud with Prime Minister Mark Carney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iranians are getting brief windows of connectivity in an internet blackout, offering a better view of the government crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ferry carrying more than 350 people sank in the southern Philippines early Monday, leaving at least 15 people dead, local officials said. It was not immediately clear how many others were missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M/V Trisha Kerstin 3, a cargo and passenger ship, was carrying 332 passengers and 27 crew members when it sank shortly before 2 a.m. near the island of Baluk-baluk in Basilan Province, the Philippine Coast Guard said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The port management authority of Bangsamoro, an autonomous region that includes a number of islands in the area, said on social media that 15 people had been confirmed dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ferry was sailing from Zamboanga, the country’s third-largest city, to Jolo Island in Sulu Province, a journey of just under 100 miles, the Coast Guard said. It was carrying fewer than the maximum number of passengers allowed, the agency added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is an archipelago made up of over 7,600 islands, most of them uninhabited or sparsely populated, with a total population of over 110 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a developing story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/multimedia/25winter-storm-toronto-lghq/25winter-storm-toronto-lghq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto was on its way Sunday to having its snowiest day on record. For a city used to harsh winters, that’s saying a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 10 p.m., Toronto Pearson International Airport had received about 18 inches (46 centimeters) of snow on Sunday, the airport said. Snow was still falling. The most snow Toronto has received in a single day was the 19 inches that fell on Dec. 11, 1944, the Toronto Star newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperatures at the airport dipped to as low as 9 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 13 Celsius) in Toronto, and with gusts reaching nearly 30 miles per hour, the wind chill reached as low as minus 9 Fahrenheit (minus 23 Celsius), according to the Canadian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sunday evening, the city had declared a “major snowstorm condition.” Mayor Olivia Chow said on social media that the peak of the heavy snowfall would end around 11 p.m., and that the city had over 600 snowplows on its roads and sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airport said that around 65 percent of all departures and arrivals had been canceled from Saturday evening through Sunday. It was unclear how many were canceled because of bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Toronto Public Library branches were closed on Sunday, as were some restaurants across the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Toronto schools will be closed on Monday. The Toronto District School Board said that classes and after school programs would be canceled. The Toronto Catholic District School Board said high school exams scheduled for Monday would be rescheduled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26winter-storm-air-traffic-vclq/26winter-storm-air-traffic-vclq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air travel was slowly beginning to recover on Monday, though thousands of flights across dozens of airports remained canceled and delayed after a winter storm brought heavy snow and ice to much of the Eastern United States over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 4,000 departing and arriving flights to the United States were canceled and over 2,000 were delayed as of 10 a.m., according to FlightAware, a flight tracking site. More disruptions were expected later and most major airlines were offering travel waivers and rebooking options for customers affected by the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the storm began wreaking havoc on Friday, airlines may be able to bounce back quickly. Because they had days to prepare, many airlines canceled flights and moved planes and workers to be ready to restart normal operations. The end of January is among the slowest periods for air travel of the year, meaning carriers have more resources and flexibility to respond to storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, said on Monday that he hoped flights would return to normal by midweek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re looking at Wednesday as our hope to get back to a normal schedule,” he said in an interview on CNBC. He added: “The snow is subsiding in the northeast, so now it’s dig-out day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the recovery could be bumpy. Sunday was the worst day for flight cancellations since the early days of the pandemic in March 2020, according to Mr. Duffy. And lingering ice and frigid temperatures could slow flights in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, airports in Atlanta, Dallas and Charlotte, N.C., saw the largest number of cancellations for departing flights, but the disruption followed the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston Logan International Airport was reporting the highest number of cancellations on Monday, with about 300, or 60 percent of its scheduled departures, according to FlightAware. Nearly half the departures out of Kennedy Airport, La Guardia Airport, and Newark Liberty International Airport had been canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flights were expected to gradually restart on Monday at Washington’s Reagan National Airport after airlines canceled all trips the day before, the airport said on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Airlines, the world’s largest carrier, was the most affected airline over the weekend and on Monday. The airline has a big hub at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world. Fort Worth was among the first major cities hit by the storm on Friday. American had canceled about 3,000 flights from Friday through Sunday, according to FlightAware. It had canceled more than 650 on Monday, more than any other carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/00int-denmark-leader-pfbm/00int-denmark-leader-pfbm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mette Frederiksen has never tolerated bullies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was in high school, Ms. Frederiksen, Denmark’s prime minister, stood up to a pack of skinheads for teasing immigrant kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t go so well. She got socked in the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this week, she ducked a punch, a big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After escalating threats from President Trump about seizing Greenland, Denmark’s gigantic overseas territory, Mr. Trump seems finally to have backed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a speech to the world’s financial elite in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would not use force to take Greenland. Later he said he and NATO leaders had worked out “the framework of a future deal” that would make everyone happy. That remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there were other factors to Mr. Trump’s reversal, like rising congressional opposition and falling stock markets, but there’s no doubt that Ms. Frederiksen’s carefully crafted defense helped block Mr. Trump from getting something he really wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, Ms. Frederiksen has played a nervous game of brinkmanship with Mr. Trump, and it looks like she has won — for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As negotiations continue, Ms. Frederiksen remains locked in an unwanted struggle, trying to calibrate how to make clear to the mercurial Mr. Trump that the answer to his demand that the United States have Greenland is a hard no, without antagonizing him into threatening to snatch it away again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, she has signaled her resistance to one of the compromises that Mr. Trump appeared to be considering — the establishment of American sovereignty over military bases on Greenland. Sovereignty, she insists, remains a “red line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent time with Ms. Frederiksen this fall, in Greenland, where she agreed to a rare sit-down interview in an old house overlooking the sea. We asked her if she felt Mr. Trump was acting like a bully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is able to speak in a very clear way,” she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So am I.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That quiet resolve, rather than flattery, has set her apart from other European leaders when it comes to handling Mr. Trump. It has made her extraordinarily popular at home. Opinion polls in Denmark show her party surging. Elections are later this year and the polls suggest she’s primed to win a third term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her rising support reflects just how much Greenland means for her country, let alone for Mr. Trump and Greenlanders themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Mr. Trump, the island represents the extreme of his imperial ambitions: seizing an enormous land from a NATO ally in what would be the biggest territorial acquisition in American history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 57,000 Greenlanders, a mostly Inuit population with long and complicated ties to Denmark, their future is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for Ms. Frederiksen, who swept into office in 2019 as the youngest prime minister in Danish history, the dispute is undeniably existential, threatening her country’s very identity, composition and stature on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s fast-moving developments demonstrated her tactical skills. After Mr. Trump, declared that since he didn’t win the Nobel Peace Prize he was giving up on peace and would push ahead on Greenland, she rolled up her sleeves, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She imported troops from her own coalition of the willing — including Britain, Germany, France and Iceland — to Greenland. She rallied Europe to speak out in Denmark’s defense. She resisted Mr. Trump’s threats of tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until that moment, many Danes had resigned themselves that there was little their country could do if indeed Mr. Trump moved on the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen’s risky strategy to call in foreign military and law enforcement personnel, albeit a tiny contingent of a few dozen and ostensibly part of an Arctic training exercise, was a signal that any military action that Mr. Trump took “would be very nasty and ugly,” said Bent Winther, a Danish political commentator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her point was that, “if you’re going to take Greenland by force, you’d have to put British and French and German officers in handcuffs,” Mr. Winther said. “I think that was part of the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen’s sparring with Mr. Trump has come to define her leadership. It started from her very first weeks in office in 2019, when she arrived at the age of 41 as the head of the center-left Social Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That summer, during his first term, Mr. Trump suggested that the United States buy Greenland, which has been part of Denmark for more than 300 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen dismissed it as “absurd,” which provoked Mr. Trump to cancel a trip to Copenhagen and call her remarks “nasty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does she regret saying that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a closed chapter,” she said in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Trump reopened that chapter again, on Jan. 7, 2025, even before his inauguration, when he said for the first time that he wouldn’t rule out using military force to get Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same day, the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., made a lightning quick visit to Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, in the depths of winter, ostensibly for business. His appearance drew a band of pro-Trump social media influencers dressed in bulky snowsuits and American flags who passed out $100 bills, which turned off many Greenlanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next week, Ms. Frederiksen held a heated phone call with Mr. Trump. According to European officials who were briefed afterward, Mr. Trump berated her for 45 minutes. She did not want to talk about that one either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A phone call between two colleagues has to be a phone call between two colleagues,” she told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Winther, who co-wrote a biography about her — “Mette F” — in 2019, traces her cool self-assuredness and penchant for underdog causes to her childhood home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father, Flemming Frederiksen, was a typographer, union leader and active member of the Social Democrats. He worked in a newspaper production room as the paper was transitioning into the automated era and stood up for workers about to be rendered obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people ask me: ‘When did you get interested in politics?’ I don’t know what to say,” Ms. Frederiksen said during our interview. “I cannot remember not being interested in politics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was shy, she said, but also strident. After recounting the run-in with the skinhead in high school, she said, “I don’t know if it tells something about my character, maybe it tells us more about his.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first political party she joined was the youth wing of the African National Congress. She rapidly rose through the ranks of the youth wing of the Social Democrats, winning a seat in 2001 to Denmark’s parliament. Mr. Winter said she arrived with “extraordinary confidence, you know, the confidence you can only feel when you are very young.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, she had a different look — casual clothes, spiky hair. She quickly gained a reputation for being a strong public speaker and unafraid of taking on party elders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her tenure has been marked by crisis. During the Covid pandemic her government abruptly ordered a cull of millions of minks (raised for fur), fearful they could spread the virus. It was a controversial decision and resulted in several high-level resignations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She survived the fallout and ultimately was credited with guiding Denmark through those years with relatively low infections while keeping public services as open as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Vladimir V. Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, she called for Europe to act. She was among the first on the continent to commit F-16 fighter jets to the Ukrainian military and boosted weapons production for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her country, like some others, has been the victim of unsolved drone incursions widely believed to have been instigated by Russia, perhaps as payback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On immigration, she has put in place some of Europe’s harshest asylum rules — including utilizing camps abroad and family separations. The moves have been criticized by human rights groups but have sharply reduced arrivals and shored her up politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we spoke with her in September, she was visiting Greenland to apologize for Danish doctors forcing contraception on Greenlandic women and girls, part of a long abusive colonial legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Danish political analysts give her high marks for how she has handled Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s difficult for me to really find any major errors,” said Ulrik Pram Gad, a respected academic on Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Gad said that as Mr. Trump began to get aggressive about Greenland, Ms. Frederiksen did a good job of coordinating with Greenlandic officials and rallying European capitals, such as London and Paris, “trying to get our message out of other people’s mouths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason? Denmark needs Greenland. With it, Denmark is the world’s 12th largest sovereign state. It sits on the Arctic Council, the leading international forum for Arctic affairs. It keeps its special (though now troubled) relationship to the United States, which has been protecting Greenland since World War II and maintains a military base at the northern end of the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When they don’t have Greenland anymore, they will lose 98 percent of their area,” said Pele Broberg, the leader of a Greenlandic political party that has been critical of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So it’s very simple,” Mr. Broberg said. “They’re important as long as they own us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen, for her part, has supported Greenland’s autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The future of Greenland belongs to the Greenlandic people,” she said. “It’s more two countries now working together than an old colony, with all what is included in that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 50-minute interview, Ms. Frederiksen was more comfortable talking foreign affairs than about her own life. She is on her second marriage, with a Danish cinematographer, Bo Tengberg, and together they are raising five children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside politics, she finds respite in spending time at the family summer house, cooking and preserving food, and staying fit through spinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said one of her most important guiding principles was keeping Europe’s alliance with America strong — or at least intact. As recently as 2024, she said that she wouldn’t allow “a single piece of paper” to slip between the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past week, she has said that she still believes in a close relationship with the United States, citing “a common interest in ensuring our security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some Europeans have loved the U.S. because of dollars and ‘Dallas’ and so on. That’s not how I am,” she told us. “I really believe that everything would have gone wrong for Europe if it wasn’t for D-Day and for the big role of the U.S. in ending the Second World War.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You saved us,” she said. “And by the way, you have done that again and again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So my starting point is that I will do whatever I can to keep us together in this world, and therefore I’m not starting a conflict,” she said. “I’m trying to solve a conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/25int-venezuela-disappeared-new-54446-cover/25int-venezuela-disappeared-new-54446-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking a 10-hour bus ride across Venezuela in a quest to find her missing husband, Carolina Carrizo fashioned a makeshift bed out of discarded sofa cushions to sleep outside Zona 7, a detention center in Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, she said, about 30 uniformed police officers looking for weapons forced their way inside her home in western Venezuela and took her husband, Omar Torres, 53, a political activist. The authorities never acknowledged the arrest, she said, and she has not heard from him since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has slept outside Zona 7 since arriving in Caracas two weeks ago. She is not even sure that he is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Trump administration’s capture of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, its interim government has drawn international headlines for releasing dozens of political prisoners who rights groups say were wrongfully detained. The trickle of releases has shone a renewed spotlight on a related phenomenon in Venezuela: people who were arrested, largely for political reasons, and then disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s words of praise for what he says is the accommodating attitude of the interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, has made families in Venezuela hopeful that the newfound cooperation between the two countries could bring freedom for dozens of people who were taken without a trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re all here, outside the prisons, because of Trump, because of what he did,” Ms. Carrizo said. “Now I just want my husband back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two weeks, other mothers, wives and girlfriends from across Venezuela have slept on the street outside Zona 7, where their tents sit next to dozens of police officers wielding riot shields. The police claim the jail is empty, but the families say that they have heard screams coming from inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel that Trump is the one who is going to get them out,” said Betsy Orellana, who said her son, Rodolfo José Rodríguez Orellana, a former police officer, is serving a 24-year sentence for participating in a plot to overthrow the government. He has been missing since August, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The locations of at least 66 prisoners are unknown in Venezuela, according to Foro Penal, a leading rights group, which tracks politically motivated detentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those, about 30 of them, like Ms. Orellana’s son, were arrested during an attempted invasion of Venezuela in 2020 known as Operation Gideon. The effort to topple Mr. Maduro, hatched by an American former Green Beret, failed spectacularly: Eight would-be rebels were killed and the rest are still in prison, and have not been heard from since being transferred in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Venezuelan government did not respond to requests for comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forced disappearances is a decades-old practice that became a notorious tool used by Latin American dictatorships against critics — from foreigners to students and political activists. The practice is categorized as a violation of international law and a crime against humanity because the authorities are obligated to acknowledge when a person is in police custody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Venezuela, some people have been missing for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Venezuelan law, detainees are supposed to be brought before a court within 48 hours, a provision that human rights activists say is often ignored. But in the cases of the disappeared, the families do not even know where they are being held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Venezuelan government unleashed a harsh crackdown, called “Operation Knock-Knock,” to stamp out dissent after a July 2024 presidential election that Mr. Maduro claimed to have won despite vote tallies showing he lost decisively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 800 people considered political prisoners are still detained after 154 were released in recent days, according to Foro Penal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in a countries where human rights are frequently violated, the disappearance of inmates is considered particularly serious because the detainees are outside the protection of the law, human rights experts said. It is difficult for families to hire defense lawyers for a case that officially does not exist, making the defendant particularly vulnerable, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International, in a report last year, said Venezuela saw a significant increase in forced disappearances after the 2024 elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People would disappear for hours, days, weeks or months, the organization said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clara del Campo, the South America campaigner for Amnesty International, said families “literally” knock on prison doors asking for their loved ones, but the guards claim no one by that name is in custody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It speaks to the ingenuity of repressive governments whereby they find new ways of applying cruelty and punishing those that they consider real or perceived dissidents,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “desaparecido” became common in the 1970s in Argentina, when a military dictatorship abducted as many as 30,000 people, tortured them and, in hundreds of cases, threw them from airplanes into the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the term was largely considered synonymous with “missing and most likely dead.” In more recent years, the practice became commonplace in countries like Nicaragua, where missing people are believed to be alive but imprisoned, with no records to document it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nicaragua, several dozen people who were detained and missing were recently released, but nine remain unaccounted for, according to a prisoner monitoring group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, Victor Borges, 39, a political activist, has been missing since Nov. 25, relatives said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is as if the earth swallowed him,” said his former partner, Yesley Bello, 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnesses told Ms. Bello that vehicles bearing the insignia of Venezuela’s Bolivarian National Police arrived at Mr. Borges’s workplace, an elite private school, where he cared for animals at the school’s petting zoo, and took him away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His family can rattle off the names of government agencies, prisons, hospitals, police stations and morgues where they have gone to ask about him. Each time, the family said, they were told the same thing: No one by that name was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Bello has begun to consider the possibility that he may never return to her or his five children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will tell them about the great father they had,” she said, her eyes filling with tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martina Rapido, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, said that forced disappearance is “always a strategy to break not only the person who is detained, but also their families, sometimes in retaliation for political opposition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Rapido said the disappearances generally fit one of two patterns. They are often short-term detentions that last a few days. But others involve high-profile activists who are held incommunicado for an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marilis Rodríguez, 58, traveled 200 miles to Caracas recently from the city of Acarigua searching of her son, Carlos José Rodríguez Rodríguez. She said the police took Mr. Rodríguez, 29, from his home on Sept. 23, 2025, after accusing him of illegally selling dollars on the black market, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My son was taken from his house for an investigation,” Ms. Rodríguez said. “They were going to question him about something, and it’s going to be four months since we last heard from him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said her son, a vendor of imported goods, was not politically active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she was told at one prison in Caracas that he had been released, only to be told a day later that it was not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rodríguez’s first child, a boy, was born after he was taken, so they have yet to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family said it had tried to find him in at least five prisons in Caracas and also asked about him at every police station in Acarigua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve turned the town of Acarigua upside down,” said Adriana Graterol, a cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leomaris Prado traveled eight hours by bus from Guárico State to El Helicoide, a prison with a reputation as a center for torture in Caracas, looking for her father. Leonardo Prado, a mechanic, has been missing since Dec. 28, when she said he was stopped at a checkpoint and taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father was not politically active, Ms. Prado said, but had recently gotten into a dispute with noisy neighbors who happened to be police officers, and his family now wonders whether that triggered his detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m here because I want proof that my father is alive,” Ms. Prado said. “I want them to tell me where he is. I want them to tell me why they took him. I want them to show me the evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26int-mexico-shooting-zmgk/26int-mexico-shooting-zmgk-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunmen opened fire on a crowded soccer field in Mexico on Sunday, killing 11 and injuring 12, in an attack that appeared to highlight the persistent violence from the nation’s cartels despite the government’s efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunfire hit people who were socializing after a soccer match, according to local officials, capping a particularly violent period in Salamanca, a city of 275,000 in the central state of Guanajuato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another incident left five people dead in Salamanca on Saturday, and a week earlier, authorities disarmed an explosive device at a state-owned oil facility there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are going through a dark moment, a serious breakdown of our social fabric,” Cesar Prieto, Salamanca’s mayor, said in a video address on Sunday night. “Sadly, criminal groups are trying to subdue the government, something they will never achieve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guanajuato had Mexico’s highest number of murders last year, with 2,035 intentional homicides. That violence has been largely driven by a turf war between a local cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Mexico’s most powerful criminal group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salamanca, in particular, lies near a border that separates territory controlled by each group, and is also home to an important oil refinery. Both cartels want to control Salamanca to aid their drug-trafficking and fuel-theft businesses. Local officials said they were investigating Sunday’s shooting, including whether either cartel was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass shooting is an especially unwelcome development for the Mexican government, which has been carrying out an aggressive campaign against drug cartels in an effort to show the White House that it is serious about stopping the flow of drugs to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has been threatening land strikes against the cartels in Mexico for months, saying the groups run the country. President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico has said repeatedly that a unilateral strike would be a violation of Mexican sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, more specific threats from Mr. Trump, as well as the U.S. capture of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, have heightened fears among Mexican officials that Mexico could be in the crosshairs next. The Trump administration has also been pushing Mexican officials to allow U.S. forces in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Mexico has been eager to hit the cartels harder, hoping it can stave off any U.S. action. In recent days, Mexico announced the capture of several highly sought-after criminals, including a former Canadian Olympic snowboarder who had become a prolific cocaine trafficker. Mexico also transferred 37 accused criminals to the United States last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s efforts have helped lower the number of homicides by more than 20 percent in Mexico compared with a year prior. It has focused much of its firepower on the Sinaloa cartel, a notorious criminal organization based in the nation’s west, and has succeeded in significantly weakening the group. But security experts have said that, at the same time, the Jalisco cartel has strengthened its grip on other parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes Guanajuato. Homicides in the state dropped over the second half of last year, but the fighting between the Jalisco cartel and the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel, a local group, has meant the killing has continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soccer field where the shooting occurred on Sunday is a popular gathering point in the community, with matches drawing large crowds each weekend, said Orlando Arredondo Gallardo, a Salamanca government spokesman. “There are children, there are food stands,” he said. “Everyone attends, especially on Sundays, which is when it’s more family-oriented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12 people injured in the shooting included a woman and a child.&lt;/p&gt;

But Which Ones?</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/asia/taliban-afghanistan-prisoners.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26int-afghanistan-prisoners-01-zbth/26int-afghanistan-prisoners-01-zbth-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, U.S. and Afghan officials have secretly negotiated the release of U.S. detainees — a priority for President Trump and a nonnegotiable prerequisite for any further diplomatic engagement with the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even as at least five U.S. prisoners have been freed from Afghanistan over the past year, talks have stalled over the fate of remaining detainees, according to three people involved in the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While several U.S. prisoners remain in custody, Afghan officials say the release of the last Afghan inmate at Guantánamo Bay rests with the United States and should be part of any further deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guantánamo inmate’s case and the whereabouts of a U.S. citizen in Afghan custody remain a central flashpoint between the Trump administration, which accuses Afghanistan of hostage diplomacy, and a Taliban government that denies those accusations while it seeks recognition from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want these two American detainees to be released, and, at the same time, the fate of our detainee who is in Guantánamo should be made clear,” Zabiullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said in an interview with The Times in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar — the first time Afghan officials are making their demand public. “Our prisoner should be released.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Afghan detainee, Muhammad Rahim, is accused of acting as a courier and interpreter for Osama Bin Laden within Al Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the Taliban have decided to comment publicly on a potential prisoner swap is unclear. But it signals an impasse in negotiations with the Trump administration, which has publicly demanded the release of at least three Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Taliban say they have only two — identified by U.S. officials as Dennis Walter Coyle, an academic held since last January, and Polynesis Jackson, a former U.S. Army soldier whose reasons for being in the country remain murky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afghan officials say they do not know the whereabouts of a third U.S. citizen, Mahmood Habibi, who the F.B.I. says was arrested in Afghanistan in 2022 shortly after the C.I.A. killed Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda’s leader, in Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan’s foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, said no American prisoner was being held for bargaining purposes. “We support finding a solution to this issue as soon as possible,” Mr. Muttaqi said in a subsequent interview with The Times in Kabul. “We never arrest someone to make deals with their country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Muttaqi added, “We want progress in all areas with the United States,” including the reopening of the U.S. embassy in Kabul and strengthened security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States does not formally recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate authority, but U.S. envoys have traveled several times to Afghanistan over the past year to secure the release of American detainees. At least four have already been freed under the second Trump administration, according to the White House — none of them as part of prisoner swaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A participant in the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing release efforts, said the Trump administration would not consider any further public engagement until all remaining U.S. citizens were freed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department declined to discuss the case of Mr. Rahim, but the administration’s position was unequivocal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know the Taliban abducted and detained Mahmood Habibi over three years ago,” a State Department spokesperson said. “The Taliban should immediately release Dennis Coyle, Mahmood Habibi and all Americans detained in Afghanistan and end its practice of hostage diplomacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous administration had offered Mr. Rahim in a prisoner swap that included Mr. Habibi, but the Taliban rejected that offer, American officials say. Instead, the Taliban government freed Ryan Corbett and William Wallace McKenty last January in exchange for Khan Mohammed, a convicted drug dealer who was released from a U.S. federal prison. The Taliban later freed three other Americans — George Glezmann and Faye Hall in March; and Amir Amiry in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior U.S. official added that Mr. Rahim would not be part of any future deal despite the Taliban government’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Habibi’s brother, Ahmad, said officials from the Trump administration had promised him that there would be no deal for Mr. Rahim, the Guantánamo prisoner, until Mr. Habibi was returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have proof the Taliban’s G.D.I. arrested him, so they are only prolonging things by refusing to admit it,” Mr. Habibi said about the General Directorate of Intelligence, Afghanistan’s intelligence agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Afghan intelligence services didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Afghan official with direct knowledge of the negotiations said that the Taliban had released U.S. detainees last year, and the United States had lifted bounties on senior Afghan officials, as part of a framework meant to settle the prisoners’ issue. But recent developments, including the deadly attack on two National Guard troops that U.S. officials say was committed by a 29-year-old Afghan man near the White House in November, had brought the negotiations to a stalemate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Afghan official, speaking on condition of anonymity to comment on the negotiations, said the Taliban would be willing to discuss Mr. Habibi’s fate only after other U.S. detainees and Mr. Rahim had been released. Mr. Habibi was never part of the initial framework agreed upon last year, the official added, but Mr. Rahim was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department lists Mr. Coyle, who is from Colorado, as a wrongful detainee, and his family has taken a more visible role in advocating for his release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circumstances surrounding the detention of Mr. Jackson, like Mr. Habibi’s, are more opaque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, President Trump said in a television interview about Mr. Coyle’s detention by the Taliban, “I’m not happy about them holding anybody, especially if he’s not guilty of anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rahim, the Afghan prisoner, has been held in Guantánamo since 2008 and is the last Afghan citizen there. The United States says Mr. Rahim, now 60, had advanced knowledge of Al Qaeda attacks. He was subjected to “extensive use of the C.I.A’s enhanced-interrogation techniques,” including sleep deprivation that once lasted nearly six days, according to the Senate Committee’s Report on the C.I.A.’s Use of Torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rahim’s family says he did not do anything wrong and has asked the Taliban administration to secure his release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has never been charged with crimes while held in Guantánamo Bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26int-russia-ukraine-htbq/26int-russia-ukraine-htbq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks among Russian, Ukrainian and American officials to end the war in Ukraine are set to resume next week, the Kremlin spokesman said on Monday, after a round of negotiations that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine described as constructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days of talks, the first face-to-face negotiations by Ukraine and Russia since June, wrapped up on Saturday in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates. Mr. Zelensky said on social media on Saturday that more meetings would be held “provided there is readiness to move forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters in Moscow that further talks were scheduled for next week, though he did not specify a date. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe diplomatic strategy, said the talks were set for Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Ukrainian and Russian officials left the rare direct talks in Abu Dhabi in a somewhat optimistic mood, according to official Ukrainian statements and Russian state media reports. After months of negotiations, Ukraine and the United States have come to an agreement on much of a 20-point peace plan, but it remains unclear if Russia will ultimately agree to any proposal to end the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Mr. Zelensky said the delegations had discussed an American role in postwar security guarantees for Ukraine and that negotiations on the issue would continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, he said that Ukraine and Russia both should be willing to compromise. But Mr. Peskov, in his remarks Monday, gave little indication that the Kremlin was ready to back down on its full aims in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major sticking point is control of territory in eastern Ukraine. On that question, Mr. Peskov insisted that Moscow would accept nothing less than terms that Russia says were reached by President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin this past summer in Alaska. Russia says the American president agreed to a deal in which Ukraine would surrender parts of the Donbas region that Russian forces have been unable to capture through four years of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Witkoff, an American envoy who participated in the Abu Dhabi talks, said before those meetings that just one major issue was left to be resolved. Mr. Zelensky said the issue was territory. “It’s all about the eastern part of our country,” he said last week in Davos, Switzerland, where he was attending the World Economic Forum. “It’s all about the land.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its daily brief on the war in Ukraine, the Institute for the Study of War said the Kremlin may be using the new trilateral talks simply to stall for time, as Moscow has done repeatedly through years of on-again-off-again negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institute, a policy organization based in Washington, noted that Russia hoped to avoid the additional sanctions that Mr. Trump had threatened if the Kremlin refused to negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peace process has taken on a greater urgency for Ukraine: Moscow has intensified a bombing campaign against civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities, leaving hundreds of thousands without power or heating during a brutal Ukrainian winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Sunday evening, more than 1,300 apartment buildings in Kyiv had no power or heat, according to Vitali Klitschko, the city’s mayor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26int-iran-retaliation-vjpl/26int-iran-retaliation-vjpl-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As U.S. warplanes and aircraft carriers approach the Persian Gulf, Tehran and its regional allies are warning they will respond aggressively to a potential strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiery rhetoric has been a standard part of Iran and its allies’ messaging to Washington. The last time those words were tested — when U.S. warplanes joined Israel in a 12-day war against Iran last June — the result was a relatively minimal retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent surge in threats follows President Trump’s announcement last Thursday that he was sending a large naval force, which he called an “armada,” into the Persian Gulf. “We’ll see what happens,” he told reporters as he returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials in the Middle East are increasingly worried the United States will strike Iran in the coming days, an attack that could trigger a cycle of retaliation against U.S. bases across the region by Iran and its proxy groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Monday, the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, accompanied by three warships equipped with Tomahawk missiles, entered the Central Command’s area of responsibility in the western Indian Ocean, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss those details. If the White House were to order attacks on Iran, the carrier could, in theory, take military action within a day or two. The United States has already sent a dozen F-15E attack planes to the region to strengthen strike aircraft numbers, according to U.S. officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has repeatedly warned he could strike Iran since a wave of demonstrations erupted in late December and then swelled to nationwide protests. In early January, he said the United States was “locked and loaded” if “innocent protesters” were killed. Days later, he encouraged protesters to keep demonstrating, saying “help is on its way.” Soon after that, Iranian security forces unleashed a brutal crackdown that rights groups say has killed thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no U.S. military action after the killings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iranian officials have now intensified their frequent warnings against an attack, with several officials now releasing statements daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, both Iran’s foreign and defense ministries , vowed retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our response will be more decisive and more painful than before if we become the target of a U.S.–Zionist attack,” Reza Talaei-Nik, the defense ministry spokesman said, in reference to the June war that Israel launched against Iran, and which was briefly joined by U.S. warplanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours later, the commander of Iran’s navy said the country’s armed forces are “fully prepared to safeguard the nation’s sovereignty,” according to the semiofficial news agency ISNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A massive billboard was unfurled in a central square of Tehran on Sunday, depicting a bloodied aircraft carrier in the shape and colors of the American flag. It showed a blue flight deck, studded with fighter jets exploding into white stars, and water streaming behind in streaks of red and white. A slogan written in both Persian and English read: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran’s regional dominance has starkly diminished over the last two years,. Israel has attacked and weakened the Lebanese force Hezbollah, long seen as Tehran’s most potent regional ally, and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perceived threat posed by Iran’s regional alliance, which also includes militias in Iraq and the Houthi forces in Yemen, was further undermined by those forces’ apparent reluctance to retaliate during the June war, which battered Iran’s nuclear and military sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump warned earlier in January that if Iran executed protesters, he would act, and has since argued that those threats of intervention stopped more than 830 executions — a claim that Iran’s prosecutor general denied as “completely false.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear whether Iran has executed any protesters, in part because information has been hard to verify amid a widespread digital and communications blackout across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Mr. Trump appeared to back away from a strike, after receiving a string of urgent warnings from several Middle East leaders that it could spark a regional conflagration. Iranian officials had told their counterparts in the Gulf and Iraq that their countries would not be spared in retaliatory attacks against U.S. military sites they host, according to regional officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since the movement of U.S. warships and fighter jets, Iran’s proxies have begun to openly threaten to join their patron for any retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lebanon, Naim Qassim, the leader of Hezbollah, broadcast a televised speech to hundreds of supporters at a gathering in the southern suburb of Beirut, where the group holds sway. Many of them waved posters of the Iranian flag or Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a top religious leader to Shiite Muslims across the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When Trump threatens Imam Khamenei, he is threatening tens of millions who follow this leader,” Mr. Qassim told the crowd. “It is our duty to confront this threat with all necessary measures and preparedness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kataib Hezbollah, the most powerful Iran-backed Shiite militia in neighboring Iraq, urged its fighters to prepare for a potential war in a statement on Sunday, and said that if the conflict escalated, its clerical leaders could decide to declare “martyrdom operations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A war against Iran, the group said, “will not be easy. You will taste every form of deadly suffering, nothing of you will remain in our region, and we will strike terror in your hearts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In meetings in Baghdad in recent days, Joe Kent, the director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, warned Iraqis that if Iranian-backed militias in Iraq were to strike U.S. troops, the United States would retaliate against those Shiite militias, according to Iraqi and American officials. U.S. forces maintain a large presence in Erbil, in Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdistan region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the United Arab Emirates’ foreign ministry released a statement reiterating its “commitment to not allowing its airspace, territory, or waters to be used in any hostile military actions against Iran, and to not providing any logistical support in this regard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Donegan, a retired vice admiral and former top Navy commander in the Middle East, said that the outcome of any attack on Iran’s government is unpredictable, which is why Mr. Trump’s likely aim, he said, would be to improve his position in future negotiations rather than an outright military victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite past attacks against their missile systems and command-and-control, they still have a lot of missiles and drones that can strike U.S. bases in the region. So an element of this U.S. posture will be reinforced defense,” he said. “I see this current posture of forces as a maximum pressure move with a ‘deal’ being the desired outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26int-israel-ran-gvili-new1-hvqg/26int-israel-ran-gvili-new1-hvqg-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel recovered the remains of its last captive from the Gaza Strip on Monday, scouring a cemetery to unearth the body of a 24-year-old police officer and help a traumatized nation turn the page on one of the most agonizing chapters in its history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli military said it had found and brought back the body of Master Sgt. Ran Gvili, a member of an elite police counterterrorism unit who, recuperating from a fractured shoulder, had rushed into battle as Hamas led a surprise assault on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the two-year war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completing the recovery of Israel’s fallen paves the way for the next phase of President Trump’s peace plan for Gaza. The plan calls for Israel to reopen the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, allowing Palestinians who fled the enclave to return home for the first time. But Israel had refused to reopen the border until Sergeant Gvili’s body was returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Monday, hours before saying it had recovered Sergeant Gvili’s remains, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that Israel would open the crossing after finishing the search. After the announcement that Sergeant Gvili’s body had indeed been retrieved, a spokesman for the Israeli military unit responsible for overseeing passage in and out of Gaza, Shimi Zuaretz, said that Rafah would reopen in the “next days.” The Israeli government would have to sign off on the exact timing, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Gvili was shot while defending one of southern Israel’s border communities, Kibbutz Alumim. He was then seized and taken to Gaza by militants from Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed extremist group that joined in the attack, according to the Israeli authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Gvili was among about 250 people that Palestinian militants abducted on Oct. 7, most of them civilians, during an attack that left about 1,200 people dead in Israel and unleashed a war that killed some 70,000 Palestinians. Many of the hostages were released during two brief cease-fires, but dozens perished in captivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israel Defense Forces said it identified his remains using dental records, after finding his body in a cemetery in central Gaza, in a search that began Sunday morning. Israeli news reports said more than 200 other graves were examined before Sergeant Gvili’s was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, posted a video in which he spoke by phone with Sergeant Gvili’s parents. After they described their relief and thanked him and the entire army, he said, “We have completed the mission of bringing everyone back, and we upheld a very meaningful I.D.F. value — leaving no one behind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing about the war had been more tormenting to Israelis than the drawn-out captivity of those, alive and dead, who remained in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It fueled a powerful antiwar movement aimed at bringing the hostages home, galvanized mass protests in the heart of Tel Aviv and inspired angry slogans on banners, billboards and car bumpers across Israel. Hostages’ families blamed Mr. Netanyahu for prolonging the war and endangering their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fate of the hostages also turned President Trump into an Israeli national hero when his administration orchestrated a cease-fire that secured the release of the 20 living hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees — including 250 who had been serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cease-fire, which took effect Oct. 10, also called for Hamas to turn over the bodies of 28 captives in Gaza to Israel within 72 hours. It took three and a half months for Israel to recover the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamas said it needed time and heavy equipment to retrieve some of the bodies, saying they were under rubble after two years of bombardment. Each of the bodies returned to Israel was exchanged for the bodies of 15 deceased Gazans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel accused Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad of intentionally dragging their feet over returning the remains. Analysts said Hamas may have been trying to stave off the second phase of the cease-fire, particularly its call for the group to put down its weapons, which Hamas has long regarded as essential to its identity and grip on power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamas rebuffed Israel’s accusations, saying that, in Sergeant Gvili’s case, the location of his remains had been unknown and bad weather had hampered the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a small stampede to claim credit for the recovery of his body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an extraordinary achievement for the State of Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu, who is up for re-election this year, told reporters in the Knesset. “We promised — I promised — to bring everyone back, and we have brought everyone back, every last one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Trump made this possible,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, wrote on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Congratulations to my great team of Champions,” Mr. Trump wrote on his social-media site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Hamas took credit, in its own way, saying in a statement that it had “exerted significant efforts in the search” for Sergeant Gvili’s remains, and had provided “information as it became available, which contributed to the recovery of the body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for carrying out the second phase of the peace plan are still taking shape. It calls for Hamas to hand over governing of the enclave to a technocratic committee of Palestinians and international experts, supported by an international stabilization force deployed in Gaza and overseen by a “Board of Peace” led by Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, sketched out an ambitious, almost fantastical new vision for Gaza, now in ruins, with soaring skyscrapers along the beach, industrial areas and new cities built from scratch. Land is already being cleared for construction to begin in parts of southern Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Netanyahu cautioned on Monday that rebuilding would have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are on the threshold of the next phase,” he said. “The next phase is the disarmament of Hamas and the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip — it is not reconstruction. We have an interest in advancing this phase and not delaying it, and that is what we will do. The sooner we disarm Hamas and demilitarize the Gaza Strip, the sooner we will complete the objectives of the war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Netanyahu brought Sergeant Gvili’s family to accompany him on his visit to the United States last month for meetings with Mr. Trump and administration officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time doesn’t heal my broken heart — it only reduces the chance of bringing Ran home,” Talik Gvili, Sergeant Gvili’s mother, said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all Israelis had seemed to take to heart the recovery of the bodies of their compatriots. Which may help explain why Israel’s police commissioner, Danny Levy, posted a video on Monday of his emotional phone call with Sergeant Gvili’s father, Itzik Gvili.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just want to tell you that he was found intact, with his uniform and everything on him,” Commissioner Levy told the bereaved man. “You are receiving your son as he was when he went out — even with a tear in his pants. I don’t know if that is any comfort, but it was important to me to tell you these details, that you should know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26int-china-general-khjv/26int-china-general-khjv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Gen. Zhang Youxia met with U.S. officials in Beijing in 2024, he exuded the confidence of a man who was seen as the most trusted deputy in the military of China’s top leader, Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang did not appear worried that he had to look over his shoulder to make sure he was pleasing the leader, said Jake Sullivan, who was the U.S. national security adviser attending the meeting, which lasted at least an hour. “He spoke in an unvarnished way that was typical of a military guy, but also reflective of someone who didn’t feel like he had to be cautious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That image of General Zhang’s invulnerability, and closeness to Mr. Xi, shattered over the weekend, when China’s defense ministry announced that he was under investigation for unspecified breaches of laws and political discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang’s downfall is of a different magnitude from the dozens of other generals who have been toppled in Mr. Xi’s unrelenting campaign against perceived corruption and disloyalty over the past three years. His fate has astonished even longtime experts who thought that they had taken full measure of Mr. Xi, China’s most powerful and imperious leader in generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s fair to say this is a seismic event,” Mr. Sullivan said. For Mr. Xi to “take out somebody who he had such a long history with is striking and raises a lot of questions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 75, General Zhang was old enough that Mr. Xi could in theory have ushered him into retirement. Instead, Mr. Xi made a public pariah of him. An editorial about General Zhang in the Liberation Army Daily on Sunday hinted that he was being accused of corruption, and, perhaps more important, of disloyalty to Mr. Xi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang and another commander who fell with him, Gen. Liu Zhenli, had “trampled on” the authority of the military chairman — that is, Mr. Xi — and had “severely undermined the party’s absolute leadership over the military,” the editorial said. Their actions had “rendered massive damage” on the military’s political soundness and combat readiness, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It reads more to suggest that they really were challenging Xi Jinping, that it was really a personal betrayal,” said Shanshan Mei, a political scientist at RAND, a research organization, who studies China’s military. “Corruption is mentioned, but to me this gist of what they are accused of is very political, betraying Xi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What prompted Mr. Xi to finally turn against General Zhang is now a topic of fevered speculation in Beijing and beyond. Some experts believe that Mr. Xi may have come to see General Zhang as too powerful after the general’s own rivals were toppled in previous purges. Others believe Mr. Xi concluded that systemic corruption was so deep that he needed drastic surgery to clear the way for a new generation of commanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other allegations have emerged. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing anonymous sources, that General Zhang has been accused of leaking nuclear secrets to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the investigation has drawn attention to General Zhang’s recent high-level engagements. Mr. Sullivan said their discussions of nuclear issues in 2024 — in the presence of about 20 other Chinese military officers — were strictly general. He said that he brought up nuclear weapons in the context of China’s overall military buildup, but said that General Zhang said nothing sensitive or even substantive on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was not one of the main topics of the discussion,” Mr. Sullivan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Xi and General Zhang are both “princelings,” the sons of revolutionaries who served under Mao Zedong. General Zhang’s father was a general who served alongside Mr. Xi’s father, Xi Zhongxun, in northwest China. There is no evidence that General Zhang and Mr. Xi were close as children, but their shared background might have helped to cement their bond at some point, said Joseph Torigian, the author of a biography of the older Xi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang was a celebrated war veteran in a nation where few active commanders have endured real combat. Mr. Xi kept him in office past retirement, and made him his top vice chairman of the Central Military Commission — Mr. Xi’s eyes and ears in running the People’s Liberation Army’s forces day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if formal charges are leveled against General Zhang, he may face a secret trial in the military justice system. If so, he is almost certain to be convicted and imprisoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang’s downfall “will ultimately have a big effect on the power elite in Beijing because it removes one of their safety boundaries,” said Deng Yuwen, a former editor of a Chinese Communist Party newspaper in Beijing who now lives in the United States. “Even Zhang Youxia’s personal relationship with Xi Jinping was no guarantee of his safety, so nobody can feel safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang joined the army in late 1968 and later distinguished himself as a frontline officer during China’s grinding, yearslong border war with Vietnam from 1979. Accounts from troops described him as an audacious and wily unit leader who urged soldiers to use more artillery during a series of battles for Longshan, a disputed area on the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must first grab him by his throat so that he can’t escape, advance or move, and then we strike,” General Zhang told a junior officer, Li Zhongping, according to a Chinese oral history of the war published in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Mr. Xi became China’s leader in 2012, he quickly moved to shake up the military, which was rife with corruption and organizationally stuck in the past, ill equipped to deal with the country’s expanding naval, air and nuclear weapons ambitions. General Zhang was one of the commanders tapped by Mr. Xi to help lead his overhaul of the People’s Liberation Army, or P.L.A., culminating in a major reorganization from 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Zhang was a key enabler of Xi’s military reform agenda prior to late-2015 — before Xi became powerful enough to impose himself on the P.L.A.,” said James Char, an assistant professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore who studies the Chinese military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, General Zhang, who was then the head of a military region in northeast China, joined a delegation of senior Chinese military officers who visited the United States. Drew Thompson, then a Pentagon official helping to organize the visit, said the general was strikingly confident and inquisitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Chinese officers “stood up faster and straighter when he entered a room,” Mr. Thompson in a post on Substack on Monday. He added: “He wasn’t afraid to talk to foreigners, unlike some other senior officers who were often afraid or unable to engage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that year, he was promoted to head the Chinese military’s armaments department, an office that bought weapons, a post he held until 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department had the makings of “a petri dish of corruption for all the obvious reasons: Developing and procuring expensive weapons systems makes it a nice place to collect bribes and kickbacks,” said Daniel Mattingly, a professor at Yale University who is studying Chinese military politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other senior officers who worked in the department were later felled in anti-corruption investigations. Yet General Zhang had long seemed to be spared scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the purge of General Zhang could raise questions about China’s strategy toward Taiwan and the risks of war. Mr. Thompson, the former Pentagon official, saw the general as someone who “had seen combat and been humbled by it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think he could assess U.S. and Taiwan military capabilities objectively and explain to Xi Jinping what the military risks and costs of an operation to take Taiwan would be,” Mr. Thompson wrote of General Zhang. “I worry about the consequences of someone other than Zhang Youxia providing Xi Jinping with military advice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/multimedia/25int-venezula-economy-lqcf/25int-venezula-economy-lqcf-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela’s new leader wants citizens to be hopeful, but not too hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three weeks after U.S. forces whisked President Nicolás Maduro away from Caracas, the capital, his vice president and replacement, Delcy Rodríguez, is rapidly liberalizing the economy without ceding any political control in an autocratic nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With President Trump’s blessing, Ms. Rodríguez has moved to redirect Venezuela’s oil exports from China to the much more lucrative market in the United States. Earlier this month she funneled the first tranche from these oil sales, $300 million, to Venezuela’s banking system, halting the collapse of the national currency and putting hyperinflation fears to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is rapidly rewriting laws to bring in foreign investment and boost wages, leading many economists to forecast double-digit economic growth in Venezuela this year. She is promising economic transparency and accountability, an implicit recognition of years of looting of state funds by the government that she has served for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expectation of an economic bonanza has triggered a rally on Caracas’s small stock exchange and led to a surge in real estate prices. The prices of Venezuela’s bonds, long in default, are rising on hopes Ms. Rodríguez will restructure the country’s debt. As the Trump administration hints it might roll back more U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, foreign investors are lining up scouting missions in Caracas, hoping to snap up the cheap real estate, mines and factories devalued by years of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are expecting that 2026 will be a better year,” Ms. Rodríguez, 53, told Venezuela’s governors and mayors in a televised address last week. “We know that it will be this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sense of economic euphoria is spreading in the shadow of a deeply repressive state, which Ms. Rodríguez has so far shown little sign of dismantling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavily armed security agents have been stopping drivers and checking their phones on Caracas’s roads. Several checkpoints manned by military counterintelligence officers have sprung up near Ms. Rodríguez’s residence in her densely populated upmarket neighborhood in eastern Caracas, checking locals and passers-by alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Rodríguez’s government has released some political prisoners, more than 200 according to rights groups, but hundreds remain behind bars. And some new prisoners have already taken the released detainees’ places, a process that the opposition calls Venezuela’s “revolving door” of repression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former political prisoner, an American named James Luckey-Lange, said in an interview that as prison authorities were preparing to release him and a group of other detainees this month, they were simultaneously processing a group of new arrivals, including a 17-year-old. Practically all of them, including Mr. Luckey-Lange, had been accused of crimes related to terrorism, charges that rights groups say are nearly always fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the economic front, Venezuelan financial regulators have been constantly calling the owners of Venezuela’s publicly traded companies, asking them to justify the surge in their stock prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regular procedure took on a threatening undertone in a country where dozens have been detained for allegedly celebrating Mr. Maduro’s downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several businessmen contacted by the regulators recounted the ensuing absurd discussions, in which they tried to explain to the officials why their stock is surging, without mentioning the downfall of an autocrat largely responsible for one of the deepest economic collapses in modern history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Maduro’s fall has so far brought no noticeable change to Venezuela’s severely restricted freedom of expression. At least two prominent Venezuelan journalists have been castigated or threatened by officials for mentioning taboo topics in their programs since the U.S. attack on Caracas on Jan. 3, according to the people involved, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taboos have including mentioning the name of the exiled opposition leader María Corina Machado, who has been lobbying lawmakers in Washington to force new elections in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere of fear that has gripped government opponents in Venezuela for years has now even spread to an unlikely new group: officials and businessmen who owe their positions and fortunes to personal ties with the Maduro family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since taking office, Ms. Rodríguez has demoted or fired several Maduro loyalists and overhauled the second tier of the country’s military command, even as she continued to publicly assert that she is a mere caretaker working for the president’s return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most prominent dismissal thus far targeted Alex Saab, a powerful Colombian businessman sanctioned by the United States for laundering money for Mr. Maduro. Ms. Rodríguez worked with the U.S. military this month to force a tanker carrying oil belonging to Mr. Saab to return to Venezuela, and in the past week she removed the businessman from his government posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Rodríguez’s supporters in the government said the interim leader is trying to thread a needle. She is trying to increase her popularity by working to create a sense of hope and optimism in the country after 13 years of Mr. Maduro’s rule. But this optimism cannot spill into open celebrations, according to people who know her, who spoke on condition of anonymity to be able to discuss sensitive matters. The fear, they said, is that open celebrations could provoke a violent counterreaction from paramilitaries loyal to the ousted president, who have been pining for revenge after the humiliation inflicted on them by the U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Rodríguez’s critics say the lack of any meaningful political concessions since Mr. Maduro’s downfall is a feature of her governing model, not a temporary glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Rodríguez, they say, may be trying to recreate the path of economic development followed by China, which in the 1980s opened up to foreign investment and market forces, without sacrificing the ruling party’s monopoly on power. Some commentators have already taken to calling her Delcyping, a reference to Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China’s market liberalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outcome may be difficult to replicate. Some government insiders say Venezuela remains a more open society today than China was at the time, and the expected economic boom is likely to lead many Venezuelans to demand greater say in how any new oil wealth is spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And unlike China, Ms. Rodríguez’s government depends for its survival today on an outside power, the United States, which may have other ideas about how the country should be governed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A combination of economic liberalization and outside pressure could also lead Venezuela to replicate the path of another superpower, the Soviet Union. In the late 1980s, a more open economy exposed the shortcomings of its political system, emboldened its citizens and brought down one-party rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26gaza-rafah-lbhq/26gaza-rafah-lbhq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel has said that it will reopen the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt within days for travelers on foot, a move that would allow Palestinians who fled the enclave during the two-year war to return home for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aid officials said they hoped that the reopening of the border crossing would also allow them to evacuate those in Gaza who need medical care abroad — thought to number more than 18,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a social media post early Monday morning, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that the border crossing, near the city of Rafah, would reopen after the completion of a search in Gaza for the remains of the last captive yet to be returned to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on Monday, the Israeli military announced that it had at last found the remains of the captive — Master Sgt. Ran Gvili, a police officer shot during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023 — after months of searches in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel agreed to allow the Rafah crossing to reopen as part of the cease-fire deal struck in October. But Israeli leaders demanded that Hamas first returned the remains of all deceased Israelis and foreign nationals in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with Mr. Gvili’s body back in Israel, that mission was complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel’s decision to reopen the border — where both Israel and Egypt are expected to impose tight scrutiny over who crosses — advances the fragile cease-fire with Hamas. Yet the next steps for implementing President Trump’s plan for Gaza, which include disarming Hamas and deploying an international force there, are mired in uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 100,000 Palestinians have left Gaza since the beginning of the war, according to Palestinian officials. Now, many of them must decide whether to return to the enclave, most of which lies in ruins after two years of Israeli bombardment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Displaced Palestinians in Egypt Await Reopening of Gaza Border&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli government is still refusing to let foreign journalists into Gaza. It argued in a Supreme Court hearing Monday morning that to do so would put Israeli soldiers at risk even though the cease-fire is more than three months old and Israel has allowed international aid workers to enter the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For foreign journalists, Gaza has been off-limits since the start of the war in 2023, except for a small number of reporters invited on carefully controlled, abbreviated visits escorted by Israeli soldiers. A longstanding petition by foreign journalists seeking to report from inside the territory was considered by the Israeli Supreme Court on Monday after numerous delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In oral arguments, Justice Ruth Ronnen suggested that the Rafah crossing’s reopening could allow foreign journalists to enter Gaza through Egypt. But a lawyer for the Foreign Press Association, Gilead Sher, argued that the group’s 400 members, who include employees of The New York Times, should be able to enter from Israel, where they are based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We see international aid entering daily to the Strip, we see international aid workers and U.N. workers, and Israelis entering,” along with officials of the World Bank, Mr. Sher said, according to a pool report. “But foreign journalists are prohibited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government lawyer, Yonatan Nadav, said that letting journalists into Gaza posed risks to Israeli soldiers, but he agreed to describe those risks only in a closed court session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for the Union of Journalists in Israel, Amir Basha, also spoke in favor of letting foreign journalists into Gaza, arguing that they represented a vital and missing source of independent information, alongside the Israeli military and Palestinian reporters in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one is arguing with the aid workers’ value,” he said. “But journalists should not be last, they should be first among equals. Because of the information that journalists offer to the public, it cannot be that the Israeli public’s right to know is last in line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court did not say when it would issue a ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rafah crossing lies near what was once the southern city of Rafah, which was largely razed by Israeli forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first nine months of the war, tens of thousands of Palestinians were able to flee to Egypt through the crossing. Some were sponsored by international aid groups who coordinated their exit with Israel and Egypt. Many others paid exorbitant bribes to intermediaries connected with the Egyptian government to secure exit papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, that tenuous escape was cut off as Israeli forces swept along the Gaza side of the border and seized the crossing. Israel and Egypt could not agree on conditions for reopening the border, which has mostly been closed ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closure cut off a key route for severely ill and wounded Gazans seeking medical treatment outside the enclave’s battered health system. Some Palestinians, such as cancer patients needing chemotherapy, died without access to proper treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential for renewed conflict in Gaza is still very much present. Hamas has entrenched its control over half of the enclave, the Israeli military controls the other half, and most people are still huddled in crowded tent camps or in the rubble of half-destroyed homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamel Ayyad, 53, fled for Egypt in November 2023 with his wife and three daughters. While he said that he hoped to return to Gaza, he noted that most of his friends and acquaintances say that going back now is too risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gaza’s still experiencing a cold war, or an unofficial war — it’s not stable,” said Mr. Ayyad, an official with St. Porphyrius, a Greek Orthodox church in Gaza. “No one wants to gamble with the lives of their family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is far from clear how long Gazans will be able to stay in Egypt, which has made clear that their presence ought to be temporary. “We’re between a rock and a hard place,” Mr. Ayyad said.&lt;/p&gt;

Not in the Age of Drone Warfare.</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/europe/ukraine-russia-winter-snow-donetsk-dnipro.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/00int-ukraine-winter-warfare-01-whgm/00int-ukraine-winter-warfare-01-whgm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two Russian soldiers, trudging through an expanse of knee-deep snow, came into view once the sun was up. Separated from his mate by about two car lengths, the first was trying to quicken his pace. But the soldier behind him kept falling over in his attempts to step in the fresh footprints, losing his rifle and getting stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian officers were closely watching each step and misstep in real time, a hovering drone transmitting video to a bank of screens in their warm command post. Spotted at 7:09 a.m., the two Russian soldiers were presumed dead 15 minutes later, after a Ukrainian strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode served as a grim illustration of the evolution of winter warfare in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the conflict, which began in February 2022, tanks and other heavy armor dominated the battlefield. While the hulking equipment could move when a deep freeze hardened the ground, fighting slowed overall in the winter, as snow and mud made it more difficult to get around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as omnipresent drones watch and attack from the skies, heavy armor struggles to move in any season. Tactics have changed: Russia sends small groups of soldiers on motorcycles or on foot to try to infiltrate Ukrainian lines, hoping they are less noticeable to drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these small groups, the mission is largely the same no matter the time of year. So the fighting mostly keeps the same pace — a plodding one — from season to season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing really changes, summer or winter,” said a Ukrainian infantry platoon commander who, according to military protocol, went by his call sign, Salo. “The only difference is the cold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the fighting now dominated by drones, weather variations during the winter have become “exponentially more consequential than in previous years,” said Franz-Stefan Gady, a Vienna-based military analyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some aspects of winter weather make it easier for troops to advance in the drone age. Some make it harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees are bare, their leaves no longer providing camouflage. That makes troops more exposed to drones and renders any movement dangerous. Footprints in the snow are easy to spot from above. Lower temperatures make thermal cameras on drones more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drone officer one recent afternoon was counting on snowfall in the Dnipro region of eastern Ukraine. While the sky was blue outside his command post, a light snow was falling closer to the front line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can clearly see tracks in the snow, where they lead, and identify positions where the enemy is hiding,” said the officer, who goes by the call sign Shirley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any further deterioration in the weather, however, would pose a problem, the officer warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once the snowfall intensifies, we lose visibility,” he said. “For us, that is the most dangerous time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian forces use overcast weather, fog and heavy snow as cover for infiltration attempts, according to analysts and soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A higher percentage will make it past the front line when the weather’s bad,” said Rob Lee, a military expert at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme cold, as Ukraine has been experiencing in recent weeks, can also cut both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigid temperatures pose age-old difficulties for soldiers on the front lines, degrading their abilities to move and fight. “These guys are outdoors for days at a time,” Mr. Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is also hard on drones. Low temperatures can degrade battery life. If it is snowing, certain drones can become inoperable. That risks enemy advances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Weather and tech are not friends,” a drone sergeant using the call sign Sol acknowledged, saying that snow was affecting his teams “a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting on a futon in a small apartment, with drones and model cars decorating the walls, he explained how the propellers on some drones were prone to freezing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cope, he said, some crews try to warm their drones near gas stoves. Others have tested expensive de-icing sprays. But of all things, he said, rubbing simple meat fat on the propellers has proved most effective, providing a layer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sol’s teams fly first-person-view drones, which are piloted through a live video feed. Those drones, along with smaller hobbyist models adapted for the battlefield, are most affected by weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When those cannot fly, Ukraine’s military often turns to large bomber drones, known as Vampires. Teams flying those drones had far less work in the summer, said a platoon sergeant with the call sign Black, but “now we fly around the clock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartoonishly large snowflakes fell around him as he loaded up a truck bearing supplies for his drone pilots on the front line. A few times he stopped to check his watch. Icy roads would force the truck to drive slowly, making it a tempting target for Russian drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down the road about 15 miles toward the front line, Daryna, a medic, sat inside her small field hospital. The beds had electric warmers going, and two stretchers stood ready with silver thermal blankets. But there were no patients that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather, she said, was partly to blame. Snow was making it tricky to move the wounded off the front line without coming under attack by drones. Fatalities increase, she said, when medical care is delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A year ago, we were receiving guys wounded two-three hours ago,” said Daryna, who asked that her surname be withheld for her safety. “Now, we’re getting guys who were wounded a week ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunkers have also changed. They must be dug deeper because of the threat of drones, which is harder to do when the ground is frozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troops must stay in the bunkers and avoid movement, which “significantly increases the chances of survival,” said Salo, the infantry platoon commander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that drones do “an enormous amount of work.” But he said that infantry remained critical, and not only because bad weather could ground drones or reduce visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The human factor still has to be present,” he said, because “infantry holds the line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts said it was unclear whether Russia or Ukraine would benefit more from the winter weather. Much depends on the severity of the cold and snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drone warfare’s weather dependency has created a paradox: Both sides depend on unmanned systems for situational awareness and precision strikes, yet both face constrained operational windows,” said Mr. Gady, the military analyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, he noted that winter tended to favor defenders, a view echoed by several Ukrainian soldiers interviewed in the Dnipro region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian troops are looking to advance, they say, while Kyiv’s forces must simply stay in place and hold the line, limiting their exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Winter,” said Black, the platoon sergeant, clapping his hands together for warmth, “just has to be endured and waited out.”&lt;/p&gt;
