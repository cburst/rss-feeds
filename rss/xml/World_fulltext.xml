&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22int-europe-assess01-photo-gqmv/22int-europe-assess01-photo-gqmv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depth of the rift between President Trump and Europe was on full display on Wednesday as Mr. Trump delivered remarks in Davos, Switzerland, airing his disdain for Europe’s immigration policies, its regulations and its strident unwillingness to give him Greenland, which he insists America must own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, Europe has been looking to find a diplomatic answer to de-escalate the crisis. Hope for such an off ramp came late Wednesday, when Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social to announce that he and Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, were working on a deal that could resolve the dispute over Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. He suggested that tariffs he had previously threatened to impose on European nations starting Feb. 1 would no longer kick in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither he nor NATO provided any details of what such that framework might look like, and there is no guarantee that such a deal will be finished. A member of the Danish parliament from Greenland called the deal into question in a social media post, saying it had created “total confusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dust had not yet settled Wednesday night. But one thing was clear. Mr. Trump’s comments throughout the day underscored just how little the United States and Europe — long the closest of allies — now have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we may no longer be literally staring down the barrel of a gun on the trans-Atlantic relationship, we are still in a very rocky place,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are fundamentally at odds, in a way that can only reflect the very different values between most governments in Europe and the Trump administration,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders, many of them shocked by Mr. Trump’s threats to take over the sovereign territory of an E.U. member and NATO ally, must still come together on what they might or should do if Mr. Trump changes his position again — and about the trans-Atlantic relationship more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening, leaders from across the 27-nation European Union will gather in Brussels to discuss the perilous state of Europe’s relationship with the United States. They may discuss the contours of the plan Mr. Trump alluded to in his social media post. They will debate how they should approach this new and more hostile era, especially when Russia is still waging war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump had announced over the weekend that he intended to apply levies of 10 percent on several European nations that have recently sent troops to Greenland as part of a NATO exercise. Although he has suspended those tariffs, it is unclear if that will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mere possibility set off a panicked flurry. European ambassadors met for an emergency gathering on Sunday to discuss the development, and many European leaders called Mr. Trump directly. Thursday’s summit was called in response to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion is likely to touch on the state of play after the gathering in Davos, including Mr. Rutte’s discussion with Mr. Trump. Leaders will also vet what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the tariff issue is resolved, and even if the Greenland matter is resolved, Mr. Trump’s aggressive push for the island — and his language about Europe in recent days and weeks — have exposed a serious rupture forming between the partners that is far from healed. Europe is grappling with a changed reality, after decades in which it relied on a stable relationship with the United States for both trade and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The shift in the international order is not only seismic — but it is permanent,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said on Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior European official, speaking anonymously to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters, appealed for a bit of calm, noting that Mr. Trump recently threatened to sanction any country that did business with Iran, but has not done so until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson, he suggested, was to keep Europe’s powder dry, not to overreact and escalate needlessly with a key ally, and push for diplomacy. To that end, he said the bloc should be ready to retaliate — to have leverage — but should not react unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union already has a 93 billion euro, or $107 billion, list of U.S. goods prepared that it is poised to hit with retaliatory tariffs after Feb. 6. The list was finalized last year in response to Mr. Trump’s earlier trade war, and it will snap into place automatically unless E.U. officials take proactive moves to suspend it — making it a natural first step, should retaliation prove necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump also had his usual harsh words for NATO during his speech on Wednesday, asserting that NATO allies would not come to the aid of the United States if attacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the only time Article V of the NATO treaty, the commitment to collective defense, was ever invoked was to aid the United States after it was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NATO troops fought alongside American soldiers in Afghanistan for a decade, and Denmark itself had more soldiers die per capita in Afghanistan than America did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, at Davos, Mr. Rutte, the NATO secretary general, praised Mr. Trump for pushing member states to spend more on their own defense, which has strengthened the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked if he could imagine NATO without the United States, he said simply, “No.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States “is by far the most powerful nation on earth, and the president of the United States is the leader of the free world,” he said, adding, “And you cannot envision NATO without the leader of the free world being an integral part of that organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rutte also touched on the most pressing security issue for Europeans, which is Russian aggression against Ukraine — right on the E.U.’s borders — and not an icy island in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The risk here is that we focus, of course, on Greenland, because we have to make sure that issue gets solved in an amicable way,” Mr. Rutte said on a panel in Davos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ukraine should be our No. 1 priority, and then we can discuss all the issues, including Greenland,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22xp-greenland-cyprus1-bvth/22xp-greenland-cyprus1-bvth-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few details have emerged about the framework of a tentative deal that President Trump said he had reached with NATO over Greenland, but one proposal under discussion would allow the United States to own pockets of land in Greenland for military bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western officials who spoke to The New York Times compared the idea to a 60-year-old agreement under which Britain operates sovereign military bases on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. Those bases, known as Sovereign Base Areas, or S.B.A.s, occupy an unusual position in international law, one that is deeply rooted in Britain’s colonial history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts said that Mr. Trump may be interested in a similar type of arrangement because the bases could give the United States a permanent presence in Greenland while offering greater control over the region and possibly the ability to exploit natural resources in the territory and the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said on Thursday, however, that he was not in favor of giving the United States sovereignty over military bases there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are ready to discuss a lot of things,” Mr. Nielsen said, adding, “Sovereignty is a red line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about the bases in Cyprus and what they might signal for Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus consist of two large areas in the southwest and southeast of the island, making up about 100 square miles. They were established in 1960 as part of an agreement that gave Cyprus independence from Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bases are British overseas territories, like Bermuda and the Falkland Islands, and while the bases resemble U.S. military outposts around the world — like the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba or Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan — the territories in Cyprus are very different. They are not merely areas where military powers exercise control, but are subject to British sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It means that officially British law applies, and that the Sovereign Base Areas are actually not in the Republic of Cyprus or the E.U.,” said Prof. Costas M. Constantinou, who teaches International Relations at the University of Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sovereign Base Areas have separate court systems and police agencies. The borders, however, are largely open and no passport is needed for Cypriots to enter. Over the years, the S.B.A.s have also harmonized their laws on civilian affairs with those of Cyprus, Professor Constantinou said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the idea of creating American bases in Greenland similar to the ones Britain maintains in Cyprus would likely be much more beneficial to the United States than taking over all of Greenland, which Mr. Trump said was his initial goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar arrangement, he said, would allow the United States to avoid the expensive and sticky issues that come with governing populations, as the British learned well in Cyprus, while also allowing the bases to “come under full U.S. control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S.B.A.s in Cyprus do not grant Britain an exclusive economic zone in the country, which would allow Britain to exploit natural resources in the waters near the bases, said Prof. Andreas Stergiou, who teaches about European institutions and international relations at the University of Thessaly in Volos, Greece, and is an expert on security issues in the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The United Kingdom never, never attempted to raise a claim in the mineral exploitation of Cyprus,” he said. “Because they don’t have full sovereignty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greenland, however, that is something Mr. Trump could negotiate, Professor Stergiou said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the United States intends to exploit the minerals that are to be found in and around Greenland, they have to include a special provision in the treaty,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just by establishing a military facility there, they do not get the right, even if the military facility enjoys the special privileged status of the British sovereign military bases of Cyprus,” he added. “It’s not enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States already has one military base in Greenland, in the territory’s north, and it enjoys sweeping military access to the territory. Creating a sovereign base, however, could be a “steppingstone,” Professor Stergiou said. It could allow the United States to raise additional “sovereign claims,” which are generally given more weight in international law, in future disputes over resources in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Cyprus is any guide, establishing a sovereign base area on Greenland could lead to tensions with locals and other world powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain initially paid to use the land in Cyprus, giving the local government around 12 million Cyprus pounds (roughly $33 million) from 1960 to 1965, before halting payments. Since then, there have been a number of unsuccessful attempts by Cyprus to force Britain to pay for the use of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, some Cypriots have been critical of the presence of the bases, which they say were created at independence without the approval of the general population of Cyprus. The bases, which have played roles in conflicts in the Middle East, have also been the sites of demonstrations against military actions in Iraq and the war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Stergiou said it was possible that a sovereign U.S. military presence in Greenland would draw similar attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The bases might enhance the security environment and the security of Greenland,” he said. “However, it entails the risk to embroil Greenland into conflicts Greenland has nothing to do with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlanders gathered in several cities and towns last weekend to protest Mr. Trump’s plans to take over the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cyprus, protests against the British bases have never snowballed or become overly violent, Professor Constantinou said, because the country has for decades been distracted by its own political and ethnic disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also noted that there are locals who support the British military presence on the island, especially those who are employed by the S.B.A.s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While people in Greenland and Denmark await more details about agreement between Mr. Trump and NATO, some argue that any deal establishing a sovereign base area would be a reversal of the international principles of self-determination that have been in place since the end World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are new forms of colonialism through which imperial powers manage to retain control without the burden of governance,” Professor Constantinou said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are not as visible as standard colonies, whereby foreign powers ruled over local populations,” he added. “They are more palatable, more acceptable forms of sovereign control.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22int-UK-BARRON-TRUMP-ckwz/22int-UK-BARRON-TRUMP-ckwz-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early hours of a cold January morning last year, the City of London police received an emergency phone call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m calling from the U.S.,” the caller said. “Uh, I just got a call from a girl, you know, she’s getting beat up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker was Barron Trump, the youngest child of President Trump, and the details of the call became public during a trial in London this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matvei Rumiantsev, 22, a Russian citizen, is charged with offenses including assault, strangulation and rape against his former partner, the woman Mr. Trump referred to in his call to the police. The woman cannot be named because, as a victim of an alleged rape, she has an automatic right to lifelong anonymity under British law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Metro, the British newspaper that first reported on the trial, the woman testified in court on Wednesday and said of Mr. Trump, “He helped save my life. That call was like a sign from God at that moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president’s son will not appear in person to testify at the trial, prosecutors said, but his emergency call has been used as evidence, along with an email that he sent to the City of London Police last May after they wrote to him requesting a formal witness statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump described the woman in the email to the police as someone “who I am very close with” and said that he had met her over social media. The White House did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his email to the police, Mr. Trump wrote that he had called the woman and “didn’t expect her to pick up due to the difference in the time zone.” He wrote that the phone was then answered, “but not by her to my dismay.” He described the man who appeared in the video call as shirtless and with dark hair. “This view lasted maybe one second and I was racing with adrenaline,” he wrote. “The camera was then flipped to the victim getting hit while crying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rumiantsev has denied all the charges. At the trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in northeast London on Thursday, he said that the woman had been violent toward him on the night in question and had attempted to punch him in the face. He said that he noticed that the cellphone was ringing, and saw on the screen that it was Mr. Trump. “I answered the call, I immediately put the camera towards her,” he told the court, adding: “I thought maybe she would realize her behavior was unreasonable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump, 19, grew up in the public eye. He was 10 years old when his father first entered the White House in 2017. His parents tried at the time to shield him from publicity, but as he grew older and went to college at New York University, media coverage increased. In 2024, he co-founded a cryptocurrency firm with his siblings and has appeared on many podcasts on behalf of his father, increasing his visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recording of Mr. Trump’s call was played at the trial on Wednesday, and a transcript was provided by prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police received the call at 2:23 a.m. local time on Jan. 18, 2025. The transcript showed that Mr. Trump told the call handler from the City of London Police: “It’s really an emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump, who did not identify himself on the phone, gave the police the woman’s name and address and said that he had witnessed an assault on a video call minutes earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the call handler asked how he knew the woman, Mr. Trump replied: “I mean these details don’t matter, she’s getting beat up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call handler told Mr. Trump that they needed to take more information, including how he knew her, and Mr. Trump replied: “I don’t think these details matter, she’s getting beat up, but okay fine, also I met her on social media, I don’t think that matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call handler said: “Can you stop being rude and actually answer my questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After answering several more questions, Mr. Trump said: “She’s getting really badly beat up and the call was about eight minutes ago, I don’t know what could have happened by now. So, sorry for being rude.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the police arrived at the woman’s property, she identified Mr. Trump as the caller, according to Metro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents provided to journalists by prosecutors showed that the woman had made two calls to the police shortly before Mr. Trump contacted them, but that the calls were “interrupted before the operator could obtain all necessary details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rumiantsev was arrested on the same day of the call to police. He denies committing six offenses against the woman, of rape, assault and strangulation on the night that Mr. Trump contacted the police, and a previous rape and assault that he is accused of committing in November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rumiantsev also pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempting to “pervert the course of justice,” after he was accused of pressuring the woman to withdraw her accusations using phone calls and a letter from jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22int-davos-trump-wrapup01-photo-jmqh/22int-davos-trump-wrapup01-photo-jmqh-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For days, President Trump insisted that he would accept nothing less than full ownership of Greenland. He dismissed concerns that his demands were risking the disintegration of the primary Western military alliance, deriding it as impotent anyway without the United States. And he threatened economic war on anyone who tried to stop him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he took it all back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Mr. Trump’s dizzying approach to foreign policy was on full display in the thin air of the Swiss Alps. Just hours after using a keynote speech in Davos, Switzerland, to insult European leaders and demand control of Greenland, he declared himself satisfied with a framework of a deal on the Danish territory that was so vague he could not say whether he would actually own the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His threats of tariffs against Greenland’s defenders quickly vanished. After questioning the value of NATO, he declared that its leader, Mark Rutte — with whom he negotiated over Greenland — was “doing a fantastic job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re getting everything we want,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox Business from Davos on Thursday, before adding only a couple breaths later that the deal was still being negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volatility in Mr. Trump’s approach to foreign policy is a sign of just how emboldened he feels a year into his second term. He transformed a forum that epitomizes the Western establishment and the rules-based order it created into a stage for his unconstrained power to overturn the values it stands for, if he so chooses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has long spoken of his unpredictability as one of his strengths, saying there is a method to the madness that helps him win deals in ways that the tired routines of traditional diplomacy do not. His allies point to Gaza, Venezuela, Iran, Panama and other places — and to trade concessions by nations around the globe — as evidence that his techniques pay dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his whipsaw approach has also led Europeans to question the reliability of the United States and whether the world has moved on from post-World War II structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everybody’s trying to figure out, you know, what is it that — what does the president really want?” Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said when asked what European leaders had wanted to know from her in Davos. “What’s his intentions with Greenland; what are his intentions with NATO?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His sudden announcement on Wednesday that he would not follow through on a threat to impose tariffs on countries that opposed his plans to take over Greenland sent heads spinning. But it also felt familiar — he has canceled, suspended or reduced tariffs against dozens of countries, in many cases after winning concessions that were less than he had demanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump’s aides often argue that his use of tariffs is an effective negotiating tactic. After his meeting with Mr. Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump celebrated the framework on Greenland “as a good deal for everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his announcement also followed a pattern in which he claims victory in a negotiation before major details have been settled. When asked if the framework would include U.S. ownership of Greenland, Mr. Trump paused. “It’s a long-term deal,” he added, without providing specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior Danish official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy, said, “There have been no direct discussions between Denmark and the U.S. about the possibility of granting the U.S. sovereign parcels of land.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our economics reporters — based in New York, London, Brussels, Berlin, Hong Kong and Seoul — are digging into every aspect of the tariffs causing global turmoil. They are joined by dozens of reporters writing about the effects on everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Mr. Trump riding high after the dramatic U.S. military raid this month that seized Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan leader, many Davos attendees knew there could be sparks from the president’s speech on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vague threats and insults that followed were still on many minds on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, stepped onto the same stage where Mr. Trump had a day before questioned the value of NATO and had framed Greenland as a debt that needed to be paid to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Merz used his speech to note how the United States was “radically reshaping its foreign and security policy.” He pointed to the dangers of the Trump administration’s might-makes-right approach, unburdened by many postwar Western values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The United States’ global pole position is being challenged,” Mr. Merz said. “We have entered a time of great-power politics. As we forge ahead, we must never forget one thing: A world where only power counts is a dangerous place — first for small states, then for the middle powers and, ultimately, for the great ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then implicitly chided Mr. Trump for his demeaning treatment of European allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Democracies do not have subordinates,” Mr. Merz said. “They have allies, partners and trusted friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German leader’s comments echoed those of Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada, who said on Tuesday that a world order dependent on superpowers like the United States was coming to an end. In a speech widely discussed by Davos attendees, he called the phase a “rupture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump responded by saying that Canada should be “grateful to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his flight back to the United States, Mr. Trump said he would have an update on the Greenland agreement in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president’s unpredictability largely dominated a summit that in the past had amounted to a brainstorming session among financial and political elites. Attendees rearranged their meetings in order to see Mr. Trump speak. In years past, participants had been able to show up at the main auditorium only a few minutes before keynote addresses by presidents and prime ministers and find a seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, a full 90 minutes before the main event, hundreds of people jammed the entire ground floor of the enormous convention center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No pushing!” staff members said with increasing intensity as people shoved and maneuvered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of the president and his delegation brought tension to a gathering that usually features like-minded businessmen. When Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary, delivered remarks at a dinner earlier in the week, he was heckled by former Vice President Al Gore, a prominent climate activist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane,” Mr. Gore said in a statement. “And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thankfully, we didn’t come to Davos for Al Gore’s praise,” Mr. Lutnick said on Thursday on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mr. Trump’s volatility, there is also the chance that those on the receiving end will emerge better than they had expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Europeans told current and former U.S. officials at Davos that they were leaving the event feeling better than when they had entered, after Mr. Trump lifted his imminent threat of tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before leaving on Thursday, Mr. Trump again raised the possibility of pivoting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that European nations that had sold off U.S. bonds could face his wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If they do, they do, but you know, if that would happen, there would be a big retaliation on our part,” Mr. Trump said. “And we have all the cards.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davos has long been a weather vane for the world, a perch from which to observe the rise of China, the disruptive power of A.I. and now, the breakdown of the postwar order. I spoke to my colleague Peter Goodman, our in-house Davos expert, about what this annual gathering of the powerful can tell us about the strange moment we’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, you’ve come here, what, 12 times? And you’ve written a book: “Davos Man: How the Billionaires Devoured the World.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell us about Davos Man — shorthand for the hundreds of business and tech magnates and political leaders who flock to the event every year — and how he’s adapting to the Trump era. (And yes, it’s still mostly men.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davos men used to tell us that they were gathered here on the mountaintop, not just to do deals and make themselves richer, but to make the world better. They would have us believe that if we just deregulate more and cut more taxes and give them greater largess to do what they do, they will take care of climate change and gender inequality and social injustice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was always a completely absurd proposition, this idea that the ultimate beneficiaries of the status quo would be the ones to fix it. And now that pretense is more or less gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take me back to the origins of this meeting in Davos. How did it start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it goes back to 1971, which was actually another year of trans-Atlantic tension. Nixon left the gold standard. The dollar fell. The U.S. imposed tariffs on European imports. And the Europeans were totally blindsided. This German economist, Klaus Schwab, convenes this gathering of politicians and academics and business people in Davos. It gradually grows into this giant business conference that’s also an exercise in virtue signaling. The Davos motto is: “Committed to improving the state of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has Davos changed since you first started coming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change is dramatic. Some of it is physical, and some of it is ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s like a Las Vegas Strip element to how things have developed. These pop-up storefronts for the world’s biggest multinationals have totally taken over the village. When I first came here, there was a chocolate truffle place and a toy store where I bought a present for my kids. Now it’s all been taken up by giant tech companies, consultancies and crypto companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people paying the bills here like to boast: “Oh, I was in Davos for four days. I never left my hotel suite because everyone else had to come to me to court me for investments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the change in ethos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty clear that Larry Fink of BlackRock, who took over from Klaus Schwab, is leaning into making this purely a business conference. “Committed to improving the state of the world” has mostly disappeared from view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the former buzzwords — social justice, sustainability — have gone. They’ve sanitized virtually every part of it to make the Trump administration feel welcome. It was a big score that they got Trump to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Trump’s first administration, people described Trump and Davos as opposing forces. That seems to have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time Trump was here, in 2018, the conventional narrative was, it’s a clash of worlds, the globalists who want to make everything better rubbing up against the guy who’s like a wrecking ball pointed at the liberal democratic order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t really true even then, right? The C.E.O.s who pay the bills here were mostly delighted with this guy, who represented tax cuts and deregulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s a similar dynamic now. I mean, these C.E.O.s work for shareholders. They’re publicly traded companies. And by the way, they’re looking quarter to quarter. So if you ask them, what’s the long-term damage from the erosion of central bank independence? They’ll give you an answer that all things being equal, they’d prefer that the Fed’s independence be sacred, and that rule of law prevail. But all things are never equal, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that Trump is at war with anything he considers woke. Larry Fink used to write annual shareholder letters about corporate responsibility and how climate change would be solved by the capital markets. Now there’s no talk of sustainability whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the old virtue signaling is gone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, to the extent that’s there’s virtue signaling, it’s signaling to Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Instead of becoming a truly global power, Europe remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers,” Zelensky said in a speech. “Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America’s focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost, trying to convince the U.S. president to change. But he will not change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelensky’s speech came after he held private talks with Trump in Davos. The leaders tersely described their talks as “good.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/xx-bissau-vaccine-01-pfcz/xx-bissau-vaccine-01-pfcz-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West African nation of Guinea-Bissau has suspended a controversial U.S.-funded study of the hepatitis B vaccine in infants there after an outcry from public health researchers over the ethics of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved a $1.6 million grant for the study last month, days after the health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., lifted the agency’s longstanding recommendation to give the vaccine to all infants at birth. Although the World Health Organization also recommends giving the shot at birth, Mr. Kennedy said more research was needed about the effects of a birth dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, which was to be carried out by Danish researchers, swiftly became the subject of furor in the public health world, with researchers in Africa and the United States saying that it violated key tenets of ethical science. A Trump administration health official said the study had been paused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International agreements on medical research in humans require researchers to offer the globally accepted standard of care (in this case, vaccination at birth) to any participant in a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this study, half of the 14,000 infants studied were not going to be given the vaccine until they were six weeks old. Researchers were not going to screen pregnant women for hepatitis B — a basic step that would protect the babies of infected women, who could be vaccinated at birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Hilliard, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the C.D.C., said the goal of the research had been to answer questions about the effects of the hepatitis B vaccine. The study design was “based on the highest scientific and ethical standards,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in five people in Guinea-Bissau lives with hepatitis B, a virus that can cause severe liver damage and cancer, and each year thousands of infants there are exposed to the virus at birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country currently vaccinates infants against hepatitis B at six weeks of age, as part of routine immunization. The government plans to introduce birth-dose vaccination, which is more expensive, in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the Danish researchers intended to take advantage of the fact that Guinea-Bissau, one of the world’s least developed countries, is not yet able to follow the global standard. They planned to vaccinate some children at birth, and assess them over time compared with children who got the six-week dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This takes us back to bad research practices with the argument being that the standard of care is not available in that particular environment,” said Dr. Boghuma Titanji, an infectious diseases physician at Emory University. “Researchers are exploiting a scarcity situation to basically ram through this unethical study.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birth-dose vaccination for hepatitis B prevents mother-to-child transmission of the virus. Infants infected at birth have a significantly higher risk of developing chronic liver disease as adults, and many die in their 30s or 40s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Quinhin Nantote, Guinea-Bissau’s minister of public health, said the study had not received proper ethical approval, and his office has suspended it. He said the government would consider if and how the study could proceed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There has not been sufficient review to take a final decision on this study,” he said. “We don’t have the necessary input from the ethical committee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The guiding principle of my work is ‘go there.’ I want to hear directly from the people who are affected by disease, or lack of access to a new drug. I’ve been writing about global health for 30 years and have reported from more than 80 countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many public health leaders say the study poses a question that has already been overwhelmingly answered by science: The birth dose of the vaccine prevents suffering and premature death. Given this evidence, this study, in its goal and its design, is problematic, said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, chief executive officer of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the former top vaccine official for the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Essentially, you’re saying that lives of people in those settings don’t deserve the best interventions that we have available in countries with a different standard of care,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other vaccine experts have raised different concerns with the study, which has additional private funding. It is designed to look for effects from the hepatitis B vaccine that include changes in neurological development and atopic dermatitis, a skin condition, but not at whether African children whose vaccines were delayed were more likely to carry hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study grant was awarded to a team from the University of Southern Denmark whose work has been widely criticized by other researchers. Mr. Kennedy cited their work when he decided to cut off vaccine aid for the developing world, although the team has found a mix of benefits and harms that they attribute to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Christine Stabell Benn, the principal investigator on the Danish team, said the study had been approved by the relevant authorities in Guinea-Bissau and had met her university’s requirements for research ethics oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, an official with the Guinea-Bissau National Health Research Ethics Committee, who did not want to be named, citing the lack of authority to give interviews, told The New York Times that the study had been reviewed and approved in the fourth quarter of 2025, before the coup and change in government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Commodore Nanote, the health minister, told reporters in a press briefing on Thursday that he was not certain whether the ethics committee had in fact reviewed the study. “We have no evidence of any meeting they held, we don’t even have minutes of a negotiated approval,” he said. “We believe that they did not hold a meeting, did not gather and did not address the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guinea-Bissau consistently ranks among the 10 least-developed nations in the world, with a minimal health system — the country does not have a single oncologist or M.R.I. machine, for example. A military coup in November has further weakened fragile state institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavi, the international organization that helps low-income countries purchase vaccines, began to assist countries in introducing birth-dose hepatitis B vaccination last year. (Mr. Kennedy ended U.S. funding to Gavi, significantly constraining its finances. Congress has proposed restoring funding in the spending bill now under consideration.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birth-dose vaccines are more expensive because they can be harder to deliver (roughly half of women in the country give birth at home), and refrigeration and other infrastructure has to be set up in labor wards to preserve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reason that children in Guinea-Bissau are not getting the birth dose presently is not because there is uncertainty about the vaccine. It’s because they’re unable to implement their policy for resource-related reasons,” said Dr. Keymanthri Moodley, an emeritus professor of bioethics at Stellenbosch University in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the study was reminiscent of controversy in the 1990s about a C.D.C.-funded clinical trial in East and Southern Africa that tested a drug that blocked pregnant women with H.I.V. from transmitting the virus to their babies. Women in one part of the trial received a placebo — and as a result, many babies were infected with the then-fatal illness. The researchers defended the trial by saying that since the drug was not available in the countries where they tested the intervention, no one was worse off than they would have been without the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that controversy, changes were made to the Declaration of Helsinki, an international agreement that sets out the terms of ethical medical research, to require that research participants in the control group receive the “best proven” intervention. In the case of the Guinea-Bissau trial, that would be the birth-dose vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Guinea-Bissau expressed frustration with the study as an example of foreign-funded research that is not well communicated to the population who will be studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a huge lack of information regarding this health testing, or any health experiments,” Cadija Mané, a former senior official in the Health Ministry, said. “There needs to be a better flow of information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ricci Shryock contributed reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22canada-carney-bzlg/22canada-carney-bzlg-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mark Carney became Canada’s prime minister last year, he was known mostly as a technocratic central banker who had gone on to success in the world of global finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Mr. Carney returned this week from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he was suddenly a global political star. The normally reserved audience at the annual gathering of billionaires, investors, chief executives and politicians rose in an exceptional standing ovation at the end of Mr. Carney’s rousing, 30-minute speech on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Carney was praised for his candid assessment of what he called an irrevocable “rupture” to the global order caused by President Trump, and for urging other middle powers to join Canada in charting a distinct path away from the world’s superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in sharp contrast to other world leaders who flatter Mr. Trump or keep their heads down for fear of provoking him, Mr. Carney speaks bluntly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, less than a day after returning from Davos, Mr. Carney set out Canada’s direction in a speech in Quebec City, saying that his country “must be a beacon — an example to a world at sea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a time of rising walls and thickening borders, we demonstrate how a country can be both open and secure, welcoming and strong, principled and powerful,” he said, speaking where his cabinet was meeting, in a fortress built by the British more than 200 years ago to fend off American invaders. “There are literally billions of people who aspire to what we have built. A pluralistic society that works. A public square that’s loud, diverse and free. An economy that delivers broadly shared prosperity. A democracy that chooses to protect the most vulnerable against the powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued: “Canada can’t solve all the world’s problems. But we can show that another way is possible. That the arc of history isn’t destined to be warped towards authoritarianism and exclusion. It can still bend towards progress and justice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Carney’s speech on Thursday, like the one in Davos on Tuesday, did not mention Mr. Trump by name. But the reference was clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speech dealt largely with domestic issues, including a recent rekindling of support for separatism in Quebec, and appeared to be an effort to both reassure and energize Canadians who have been left angered, exhausted and fearful by Mr. Trump’s year in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every day we’re reminded that we live in an era of great power rivalry,” Mr. Carney said on Tuesday in Switzerland. “That the rules-based order is fading. That the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Carney said that for their survival, nations should no longer “go along to get along” with Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The middle powers must act together because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump have a generally cordial relationship, the two speeches underscored the Canadian leader’s plan to further distance his country from Mr. Trump’s version of the United States, the largest market for Canada’s export-dependent economy and a nation with which it shares the world’s longest land border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Canada is in a free trade agreement with the United States and Mexico, Mr. Trump has imposed a variety of tariffs that threaten key Canadian industries including autos, steel and aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how Mr. Trump’s desire to take over Greenland, another neighbor of Canada’s, is resolved, the issue has stirred concern and anger among Canadians about his threats to make Canada the 51st state. Shortly before Mr. Carney spoke in Davos, Mr. Trump posted on social media an A.I. photograph that included a United States flag superimposed over a map of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a rambling speech in Davos on Wednesday, Mr. Trump struck back at Mr. Carney’s words from the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us. By the way, they should be grateful also, but they’re not,” Mr. Trump said. “I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn’t so grateful — they should be grateful to us, Canada. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two men did not meet in Davos. On Thursday, Mr. Carney returned rhetorical fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Canada and the United States have built a remarkable partnership in the economy, in security and in rich cultural exchange,” Mr. Carney said. “But Canada doesn’t live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22dc-greenland-coldwar-01-zbgk/22dc-greenland-coldwar-01-zbgk-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last Nazis on Greenland were captured in October 1944, when American soldiers raided a hidden German weather station on the island’s desolate west coast and took dozens of prisoners. Within a year, Germany would be defeated and World War II would be over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But 80 years of both tension and cooperation between Denmark and the United States over Greenland was just beginning — culminating in President Trump’s current obsession with acquiring the Arctic island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the story begins with World War II, it was shaped by the Cold War that followed, in which the United States transformed barren Greenland into a major military asset, populating it with air bases, towering radar sites and even a never-completed underground bunker complex meant to house nuclear missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all possible under an agreement with Denmark that granted the United States nearly unlimited military freedom on the island, one that remains in force today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We did it before, we can do it again,” said Daniel Fried, a former senior State Department official who worked on Soviet issues in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Mr. Trump understands this history has been a mystery as European leaders try to convince him to drop his insistence on owning the island. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that a “framework” for a deal had been reached, but the details remained murky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era before military air power, before Mr. Trump was even born, American military planners gave Greenland little thought. But when Germany invaded and occupied Denmark in 1940, they realized that the island, then a Danish colony sparsely populated by mainly Inuit people, was vulnerable to Nazi control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With airfields perilously close to America’s east coast, important mineral reserves and an ideal location to track weather that shaped battle conditions in Europe, Greenland’s defense was considered essential to the United States. It was an idea that would persist for decades before fading briefly after the Cold War and returning with a vengeance in the Trump era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark’s king had welcomed the American force and approved a written agreement granting the broad military latitude on the island, as long as a threat existed, without giving up any Danish sovereignty. With Germany vanquished and the war over, however, his country was ready to bid the Americans farewell. “Danish public opinion was expecting a return to full control of Greenland,” explained a study of the matter by the Danish Institute of Public Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington had other ideas. The advent of long-range bombers had created a new sense of vulnerability just as the Soviet Union was emerging as a new threat to the United States. Greenland happened to lie along the most direct flight path to the Eastern United States from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenland’s 800,000 square miles make it the world’s largest island and stationary aircraft carrier,” Time magazine wrote in January 1947. It “would be invaluable, in either conventional or push-button war, as an advance radar outpost,” and a forward position for future rocket-launching sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Americans had no intention of leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news was delivered in December 1946 by the U.S. secretary of state, James F. Byrnes. During a meeting at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, Mr. Byrnes explained to his Danish counterpart, Gustav Rasmussen, that Greenland had become “vital to the defense of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the American military’s presence could be extended, Mr. Byrnes said, he had a better idea: Denmark should simply sell Greenland to America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea “seemed to come as a shock” to Mr. Rasmussen, who accurately predicted that his government would reject the idea, according to another State Department memo. But unlike the current blowup, the matter was handled “quietly” by both sides, noted Heather Conley, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who specializes in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Truman administration did not push, partly for fear that Moscow would claim that the United States had stolen land from a European ally. As the Soviet threat grew more vivid in Europe, Denmark became more willing to let American troops stay in Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1951, the United States and Denmark reached an agreement “uniting their efforts for collective defense” under the auspices of the newly formed North Atlantic Treaty Organization. While stressing Denmark’s continued sovereignty over the island, the agreement granted the United States broad freedom to “construct, install, maintain and operate facilities and equipment” and to “station and house personnel,” along with other rights related to military activity. That included deepening harbors and even maintaining postal facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement did not include an expiration date, and Denmark has never asserted one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the agreement’s few limitations was to delineate specific “defense areas” within which the United States could operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the deal in hand, and freshly alarmed by a Soviet-backed communist offensive in Korea, the U.S. military quickly went to work. In a secret crash project, military engineers working around the clock in 24-hour Arctic daylight built a major air base at Thule in northwest Greenland. Manned by thousands of American personnel, the base’s 10,000-foot runway would serve as a launching point for strategic bombers and spy planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen military bases and radar and weather monitoring stations eventually opened across the island. A 1,240-foot tower was erected at Thule for long wave transmissions to eastern Canada. In 1959, the United States started Project Ice Worm, another secret endeavor that envisioned a giant complex of bunkers, dozens of feet underground, meant to house nuclear missiles that could survive a Soviet first strike. (The project was deemed unfeasible and abandoned after several years.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as missile technology improved, the United States established more systems meant to provide early warning for a Soviet attack. While they were considered invaluable, the systems were far from foolproof: In October 1960, one U.S. radar system detected a massive Soviet missile launch with near certainty. It turned out that the system had spotted the moon rising over Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark raised few objections, satisfied that its sovereignty over Greenland remained protected. To underscore the point, a Danish flag flew alongside the American one at Thule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrangement was tested in January 1968, when a U.S. B-52 bomber carrying four hydrogen bombs crashed while trying to make an emergency landing at Thule. The bomber had been part of an “airborne alert” program run by the U.S. Strategic Air Command, which kept several nuclear-armed bombers airborne 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bombs were incinerated on impact in conventional explosions, but left radioactive traces even after an arduous cleanup. Some Danish politicians expressed outrage that the United States had brought nuclear weapons to the island, although American officials insisted that such weapons were implicitly covered by the 1951 agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the peak of the United States’ military presence in Greenland during the Cold War, some 10,000 U.S. personnel were stationed on the island. But after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the cost of a large footprint on an Arctic island made little sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. installations on Greenland were closed over the next decade, with U.S. activity consolidating at Thule, whose name was changed in 2023 to Pituffik in an acknowledgment of a former Inuit settlement there. It is now a U.S. Space Force base, staffed by about 150 people who manage early warning radar and satellite communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump argues that Greenland is once again vital to American security, and many national security experts agree. They point to growing Arctic competition with Russia and China over natural resources and shipping lanes as melting ice reshapes the region. Mr. Trump also says that Greenland is crucial to the ambitious “Golden Dome” missile defense system he hopes to build in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Trump has never made clear why he must control Greenland to serve these needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Conley of the American Enterprise Institute said that a solution, if there were one, might mirror the events of the early Cold War. Having been denied ownership of the island, Mr. Trump appears to be considering an enhanced U.S. military presence on Greenland that is part of a new NATO mission to defend the island. “That’s the right approach,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Fried agreed, but said he wished the process could have played out quietly, the way it did nearly a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trump could have achieved this without all the drama,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/23/multimedia/23xp-climbing-top/23xp-climbing-top-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Goodwin’s left shoulder felt like it was on fire and his right hand was covered in blisters by the time he finished climbing one side of Toronto’s CN Tower in 1986. Back then, it was the tallest structure in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was terrified,” he said, recalling the day he reached the base of the tower’s observation deck, 1,100 feet above a crowd of onlookers and with no rope, harness or other safety equipment. “Every move had to be perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Alex Honnold, a rock climber who was the subject of the Oscar-winning documentary “Free Solo,” will attempt to get everything right when he climbs Taipei 101, a 1,667-foot-tall skyscraper in Taiwan, without a rope. With Netflix livestreaming the climb, this niche pursuit has never received such global publicity before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling skyscrapers is not like rock climbing or going up smaller buildings. Those in the club of just a dozen or so known skyscraper climbers worldwide say it has unique and intense physical and mental demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also a largely underground sport because it is usually illegal. Alain Robert, a Frenchman who has scaled some 200 buildings since the 1990s, mostly with his bare hands, said that he has been arrested more than 170 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You feel like you’re literally in a movie,” Mr. Robert said, with “cops that are trying to catch the bad guy climbing the building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious risks make it rare for someone to obtain permission to climb a tall building like Mr. Honnold did. “I’ve never been willing to get arrested,” the 40-year-old said in a recent podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the serene natural landscape surrounding climbers on routes like El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, which Mr. Honnold scaled in 2017, skyscraper climbers must overcome urban noise, crowds and, occasionally, police officers determined to arrest them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You feel like King Kong in the city,” said Titouan Leduc, 24, a French climber who scaled Warsaw’s Varso Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the European Union, last year. He was briefly arrested after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have climbed skyscrapers say their bodies face different demands compared with rock climbing. According to Mr. Goodwin, 70, it mainly comes down to repetitiveness versus variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a rock face, each move presents a new puzzle: climbers’ hands search for different holds — crimps, jugs, slopers — and they constantly adapt their bodies. But along the side of a building, climbers repeat the same few movements hundreds of times to pass over dozens of stories of windows, steel bars and concrete gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can do a pull-up and think it’s not all too bad, but try doing 20, 50, 100,” Mr. Goodwin said. “Doing the same kind of move over and over and over — it can really tax your muscles and fingers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over decades, Mr. Robert, 63, developed his own system for rating buildings based on how difficult they are to climb. A building’s grips mattered more than its height, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave the Brooklyn Bridge a difficulty rating of two out of 10 after climbing it in 1994. He gave the same rating to the Eiffel Tower, which he scaled with his bare hands in 1996. “It’s really like a ladder,” he said of the Paris landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also the last person to climb Taipei 101, in 2004, then the tallest building in the world. He completed the climb just days after having surgery on his left elbow, in heavy rain and with a top rope, which he said the authorities had required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Robert gave Taipei 101 a rating of six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the small gaps on the surface of the Sydney Opera House, which he climbed in 1997 and rated as a seven, allowed him to hold on only with his fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1999, Mr. Robert scaled what he said was one of the most difficult buildings he had ever climbed, rating it a nine: the Sears Tower, now called the Willis Tower, in Chicago. He gave the Burj Khalifa in the United Arab Emirates, the world’s tallest building, the same grade after climbing it in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult building he ever encountered? A relatively humble 44-story office building west of Paris in 1998. He said the only way up the Framatome, now called the Tour Areva, is by jamming one’s fingers into a vertical groove between glass panels. Halfway through that climb, he said, the crack unexpectedly became so narrow that his fingers could barely fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like your entire life is hanging at the tip of your finger,” he said. He rated that difficulty a 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some climbers said they were concerned that Mr. Honnold’s climb, carried live on Netflix, would encourage reckless, untrained attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My message to kids: Don’t do it,” Mr. Goodwin said. “Unless you’re a world-class climber like Alex Honnold and Alain Robert, unless you have that ability, it’s a suicide mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For others, the danger keeps them going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only way I felt alive was when I was risking my life,” Mr. Robert said, adding that he might try climbing another building in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22int-gaza-tvmw/22int-gaza-tvmw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration laid out an ambitious and highly speculative vision for the future of the Gaza Strip at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, as Washington tries to advance the thorny cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, featured slides that depicted gleaming skyscrapers rising on Gaza’s coast and the construction of entirely new cities. The plan would require investment of at least $25 billion in the devastated Palestinian enclave, according to the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaza would be rebuilt in phases, he said, starting with the south. The southern city of Rafah — which Israel largely razed during its war against Hamas — would be rebuilt in two to three years, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We said, ‘Let’s plan for catastrophic success,’” Mr. Kushner said in Davos, adding that there was no “Plan B.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, however, those sweeping ideas exist mostly on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamas has not agreed to lay down its arms and disband its battalions of fighters. The United States has struggled to convince countries to contribute soldiers to a proposed peacekeeping force for Gaza. And it is far from clear who would provide the billions that the Trump administration’s lofty plans would require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kushner outlined the proposal during a gathering in a Davos conference room to formally inaugurate Mr. Trump’s “Board of Peace,” which the president said last year would help oversee both the Israel-Hamas truce and the reconstruction of Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the ceremony, Ali Shaath, the head of a Palestinian committee of technocrats that the board would oversee, said that the Rafah border crossing with Egypt is scheduled to reopen next week. But Israel has not confirmed that. Israeli authorities have vowed to keep the border closed until Hamas returns the body of Ran Gvili, the last Israeli captive whose remains are still in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Trump administration circulated a proposed charter for the Board of Peace that would expand its mandate to other conflicts. That has provoked fierce controversy, with critics now calling the board an attempt to set up a Trump-dominated alternative to the United Nations. Since then, some allies of the United States — including France, Britain, Norway and Sweden — have said they would not join it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said this week that Israel would join the board, although the country has expressed reservations about the makeup of one of the board’s key committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the world leaders who officially joined the board at the Davos gathering on Thursday were right-wing populists like President Javier Milei of Argentina and Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister. Close Arab allies of the United States like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar also sent representatives to sign on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the signing ceremony, Mr. Trump seemed to concede that disarming Hamas still posed a major obstacle to his plans for Gaza. He did not say how, exactly, he would pressure the militants to lay down their arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were born with rifles in their hands,” Mr. Trump said. “But they have to give up their weapons, and if they don’t do that, it’s going to be the end of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamas has agreed to hand over day-to-day governance of Gaza to the committee led by Mr. Shaath, a group of independent Palestinian technocrats backed by the United States. But it has not agreed to hand over control of the enclave’s security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the committee’s success will partly depend on whether Israel eases the restrictions it has imposed on Gaza. In recent months, Israel has kept the Rafah border crossing all but closed, even though it had agreed to open it as part of the truce agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kushner said the United States would host a Gaza investment conference for the private sector in Washington in a few weeks. He conceded that moving money into the Palestinian enclave could be “a little risky” but said it would also provide “amazing investment opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22int-philippines-journalist-wzgv/22int-philippines-journalist-wzgv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Philippine court on Thursday convicted a journalist on charges of financing terrorism and sentenced her to more than a decade in prison, in a ruling that rights and press groups said was a blatant attack on press freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Regional Trial Court in Tacloban City gave the journalist, Frenchie Mae Cumpio, and her former roommate Marielle Dumaquil a jail sentence of 12 to 18 years, the maximum allowed. But the women, who have been in prison since they were arrested in 2020, were acquitted of charges of possessing firearms and explosives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before her arrest, Ms. Cumpio, who turns 27 this month, worked as a radio reporter and wrote articles for Eastern Vista, an online publication focused on the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippines. The authorities said her coverage of the community and local politics was biased in favor of communist insurgents, who have long had a presence in the region. She was convicted of being a conduit for funds for the rebels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To many, Ms. Cumpio’s case was a glaring example of “red-tagging,” a practice by some Filipino authorities of linking their critics to the communist insurgency. She was arrested when Rodrigo Duterte was in power, a president who repeatedly attacked his critics in the media and moved to silence them. His successor and the current president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., had vowed to support a free press in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This absurd verdict shows that the various pledges made by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to uphold press freedom are nothing but empty talk,” said Beh Li Yih, the Asia-Pacific director of the Committee to Protect Journalists. “Although the journalist was cleared on the charge of illegal possession of firearms, the ruling underscores the lengths that Philippine authorities are willing to go to silence critical reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Philippines must free Frenchie Mae Cumpio without conditions and stop criminalizing journalists,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporters Without Borders, an organization that advocates press freedom, said it had carried out its own investigation into the allegations against the women and concluded that it was a fabricated case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are appalled by this verdict,” said Aleksandra Bielakowska, the advocacy manager for the group. She added that the conviction was a “devastating failure on the part of the Philippine justice system and the authorities’ blatant disregard for press freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the government’s National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict said the ruling was “a clear affirmation” that the justice system worked because the court threw out the weapons possession charge against Ms. Cumpio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This alone demolishes the false narrative that the courts are mere rubber stamps for the state or instruments of political persecution,” Joel Sy Egco, the spokesman, said in a statement. “It shows judicial independence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Cumpio and Ms. Dumaquil are expected to appeal the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22int-greenland-framework-mlkb/22int-greenland-framework-mlkb-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations to resolve the future of Greenland have focused in recent days on proposals to increase NATO’s presence in the Arctic, give America a sovereign claim to pockets of Greenland’s territory and block potentially hostile adversaries from mining the island’s minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those elements, described by eight senior Western security and diplomatic officials, offer the fullest picture yet of the contours of a potential Greenland compromise that President Trump announced on Wednesday without details. His move appeared to at least temporarily defuse an American-made trans-Atlantic crisis over the Danish territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically, the proposals under discussion would stop short of Mr. Trump’s goal of transferring ownership of all of Greenland to the United States from Denmark, according to the officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. The officials cautioned that many details have yet to be finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if these discussions will ultimately yield agreement over the territory. Denmark, which publicly opposes ceding ownership of any Greenlandic land, may not agree to the plans on the table. Still, the officials said they were hopeful that they could simultaneously address Mr. Trump’s stated concerns about securing the Arctic against possible threats from Russia and China, while holding to Europe’s “red line” that Greenland was not for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, the proposals would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a significant new NATO mission in the Arctic. Multiple officials have dubbed this mission “Arctic Sentry,” in a nod to similarly named NATO missions in the Baltic Sea and Eastern Europe that are meant to counter an increasingly aggressive Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update a pact signed between Denmark and the United States in 1951. The pact gives the U.S. military wide access to Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, for operations including the construction and operation of military bases. American officials have said they are concerned that this access could be curbed or ended if Greenland were to obtain independence. NATO officials have discussed expanding the 1951 pact with a new agreement that would effectively create pockets of American soil in the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an agreement would likely be modeled on a “sovereign base area” agreement in Cyprus, where Britain’s military bases are regarded as British territory. That would give the United States greater control over the land than it currently exerts over U.S. embassy sites. Mr. Trump and other officials have said that territory in Greenland could prove important for his plans to build a so-called Golden Dome missile defense system for the United States, which could include components stationed in Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restrict non-NATO member countries, particularly Russia and China, from obtaining rights to mine the rare-earth minerals that lie deep under Greenland’s ice sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those plans have been under discussion inside NATO over the last year, as a direct response to Mr. Trump’s stated ambitions. Since returning to the White House in 2025, Mr. Trump has described publicly, with increasing intensity, his desire to own Greenland. Denmark, with equal intensity, has insisted it would not sell, with Danish leaders saying that the island’s fate is up to Denmark, not NATO. Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said on Thursday he was not in favor of giving the United States sovereignty over military bases there. “We are ready to discuss a lot of things,” Mr. Nielsen said, adding, “Sovereignty is a red line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of giving the U.S. a sovereign claim to its bases in Greenland, similar to Britain’s bases in Cyprus, was raised among NATO and Western military officials on Wednesday, according to two officials, one of whom was present in those discussions. Asked for comment, Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich, the top NATO commander in Europe, said in a brief conversation with The New York Times on Thursday that the idea was discussed as a matter for political leaders to resolve rather than the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you should know. The Times makes a careful decision any time it uses an anonymous source. The information the source supplies must be newsworthy and give readers genuine insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark did not respond to a request for comment. But in a public statement on Thursday, posted on social media, she appeared to accept some of the details under discussion while rejecting others, including the idea of transferring ownership of any part of Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can negotiate on everything political; security, investments, economy. But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump gave almost no details of the agreement on Wednesday evening, in brief interviews with reporters in Davos that followed it, or in his public statements on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the proposed agreement, Adm. Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the Italian chairman of the NATO Military Committee, said at a press briefing on Thursday that officials were “at the very early stage” of creating a framework for securing the Arctic and Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Grynkewich said, “We’ve done no planning yet” for the joint Arctic operations. He added, “We have not received political guidance to move out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a spreading sense of relief on Thursday among European leaders that the escalating crisis over Greenland had been defused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a speech in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Mr. Trump ruled out using military force to take the island but raised the specter of imposing economic pain on allies if he didn’t get what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, that evening, he abruptly announced he had reached a deal with Mr. Rutte, and he called off the tariffs he had planned to impose on imports from Denmark and many of the European countries that had risen to its defense over Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some European leaders on Thursday welcomed Mr. Trump’s announcement and expressed optimism that it would eventually result in a victory for Arctic security and NATO unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will protect Denmark, Greenland, the north, from the threat posed by Russia,” Friedrich Merz, the chancellor of Germany, said in a speech at Davos on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will uphold the principles on which the trans-Atlantic partnership is founded, namely sovereignty and territory,” Mr. Merz said. “We support talks between Denmark, Greenland, the United States on the basis of these principles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/23/multimedia/23int-vietnam-leader-01-fckz/23int-vietnam-leader-01-fckz-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnam’s Communist Party bolstered the power of the country’s top leader, To Lam, on Friday, making him both party chief and president at its party congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Vietnam’s political process to formally announce the move has not yet taken place, the twice-a-decade congress ended two days ahead of schedule with a new list of Politburo members that indicates Mr. Lam’s dual role has been approved — evidence of what officials described as his forcefulness and consolidation of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We pledge to stand united,” Mr. Lam said in one of his final speeches on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Comrades,” he added, “the road ahead still holds many major tasks, requiring high determination, strict discipline and unceasing effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supercharged elevation of Mr. Lam, 68, a former minister of public security whose mild-mannered mien obscures his track record of embracing risk and reform, upsets Vietnam’s traditional sharing of authority among four leaders. Barring a sudden reversal, it moves Vietnam closer to the strongman model of China, which Hanoi has long avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also highlights the country’s growing sense of economic urgency and a willingness to bet big on change in a moment of global uncertainty. Mr. Lam’s agenda — laid out in resolutions and speeches that followed his rise to party secretary in 2024 — focuses on unleashing the private sector, digitizing government and getting bureaucracy out of the way of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His “streamlining of revolution,” as state media sometimes calls it, is widely seen as a framework for the most significant economic reforms since Vietnam’s first liberalization wave near the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, and now, the country worried about falling behind. Vietnam used to fear poverty and isolation. Now it sees itself as playing catch up to Asian success stories like South Korea. For years, it has been experiencing war-delayed, breakneck industrialization, claiming an economic growth rate of 8 percent in 2025 that Mr. Lam has promised to drive to double digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few countries remain as optimistic or as eager as Vietnam to squeeze upward mobility from globalization — while U.S.-China trade dynamics allow for it, and while Vietnam’s population of 102 million still has a bumper crop of young workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even party members who worry that Mr. Lam may be amassing too much power for himself and his acolytes in the country’s state security apparatus or large state-favored conglomerates said they concluded that a very strong leader represented Vietnam’s best chance to reach its goal of becoming a rich, developed country by 2045.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lam has pledged to make the most of that opportunity. In his main congress speech, at a convention center in Hanoi flush with communist symbols, where the scent of red and yellow flowers greeted delegates, he focused on “breakthroughs and action.” He called on the government to “choose correctly, deploy quickly, do thoroughly, measure by results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unlock and liberate productive forces and all resources,” he said. “Establish a new growth model; synchronously implement digital transformation, green transformation and energy transition; improve human resource quality; attract and utilize talents; develop new productive forces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His dual role makes him the top official overseeing these goals at home and the head of state representing Vietnam overseas. His predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong, briefly held both roles as did Mr. Lam, temporarily, after Mr. Trong’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, however, the Politburo named alongside Mr. Lam includes several members viewed as his strong allies. Among the “four pillars” that have now become three, there will be a new prime minister, Le Minh Hung. At 55, he is the youngest member of the Politburo, and he has a background in finance. Tran Thanh Man, 63, who became chair of the National Assembly when Mr. Lam was promoted two years ago, will stay in his position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other Politburo leaders either worked for Mr. Lam at the ministry of public security or have ties to him through his home province of Hung Yen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The key point is that To Lam is now given a strong mandate to accelerate his reforms across multiple areas, from governance to economic policies,” said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. “We’re going to see a Vietnam which is more developmental than ideological in the next five years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, he added, great power comes with a heavy burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More power can help him carry out the reforms faster,” Mr. Giang said, “but can lead to greater risks of making wrong choices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country faces many challenges. State-supported firms significantly drag down the economy’s productivity, according to economists. Pollution is worsening. Housing costs are rising in cities while luxury developments on the outskirts are ghost towns, leading to fears of a property bust. Banking, environmental protection and airport immigration lines still feel years behind for a country that wants to be seen as a peer to Asia’s developed economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside pressures add even more complex dilemmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese investment in factories has surged, a boon for short-term growth that also threatens Vietnam’s domestic industrial base at a time when Hanoi is seeking to move up the value chain of manufacturing. Competition for factory workers is becoming more intense, as Vietnam’s work force becomes older and more middle-class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the United States has been more standoffish than Hanoi had hoped after signing a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2023. Mr. Lam had pushed for the upgrade in relations, according U.S. officials. More recently, he has expressed disappointment in what has become a mixed bag of American foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently visited Hanoi to reaffirm security ties, but the Trump administration’s tariffs have stung. They have slowed growth in many industries (furniture, for one) while the lack of a finalized trade deal has paused some foreign investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lam has been frank about many of these issues. He receives praise, especially from young, Western-educated Vietnamese, for being the first party leader to talk in public about the problems Vietnam needs to solve at home and with partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if things go wrong, how will he respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts and many citizens continue to wonder if the tactics Mr. Lam used to get to the top, which included his execution of an anti-corruption drive that ended up purging many of his rivals, would return with a vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lam spent nearly his entire career in state security. Along with his economic reforms, he has further empowered the police, expanding their reach into business and surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander Vuving, a professor at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu, said the greatest risk for Vietnam’s top leader was, behind the scenes, a “lack of consensus and lack of legitimacy, which may cause him to embrace more authoritarianism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the congress showed no signs of visible discord. The meeting featured higher levels of security control than in the past, with extra efforts made to keep the media from delegates. In the convention hall entrance, officials could simply be glimpsed gathering in small groups near an exhibit promoting the party’s accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black-and-white photos of a country still struggling just a generation ago led to color spreads of gleaming infrastructure and bar charts, tall with economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also quotes in bold from Mr. Lam on what he promised to deliver: “renewal and development,” along with “a new era of prosperity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/23/multimedia/23int-uk-pubs-02-promo/23int-uk-pubs-02-gvlt-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its wooden beams, thatched roof and open log fire, the 17th-century Old Thatch pub offers a warm welcome to customers in southern England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one influential group of Britons can expect a frosty reception: lawmakers from the governing Labour Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Thatch is one of more than 1,400 pubs and restaurants to have banned all Labour legislators in a protest over a planned increase in a property tax, which landlords say will cost them thousands of pounds a year. Announced just before Christmas, when many Britons gather in pubs to celebrate the holiday, the pub ban gained widespread attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it appears to have worked. The government is expected to announce concessions within days, the latest in a series of policy flip-flops that critics have seized on as evidence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have them on the run,” said Andy Lennox, landlord of the pub in Wimborne near Bournemouth, where the rebellion began. He wants to see the detail of the policy reversal before calling off the ban: “If you don’t have the stick, you don’t get the carrot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few parts of British life generate as much affection as pubs, and angering landlords has produced an especially swift backlash from a hospitality sector already buffeted by Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic, inflation and higher energy prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trigger for the landlords’ protest was a change in business rates — an annual tax on commercial property — that was announced in November alongside the budget. The government is also ending some temporary concessions granted to pubs and restaurants during the pandemic that have been winding down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to UKHospitality, a trade body representing the sector, pubs on average can expect business rates to increase 15 percent this year — equivalent to an extra £1,400, or about $1,880 per pub, even after transitional help. In the 2027 to 2028 financial year, average rates will be £4,500 more than today and £7,000 higher the following year, the organization said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Kennell, an associate professor at Surrey University who studies the hospitality industry, said that Brexit had made it harder for pubs to recruit freely from continental Europe, and the sector was then hit hard by lockdowns during the pandemic. Pubs are also particularly exposed to increases in the minimum wage and rises in payroll tax — two other policies that Labour has introduced in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government wants to talk about big-ticket investments, where a minister can go and put a hard hat on and stand in front of a factory,” said Dr. Kennell. In contrast, he said, pubs and restaurants are often overlooked, despite their central role in Britain’s social fabric and as employers. “If you look at Italy, France, Spain, hospitality careers are seen as being prestigious,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the government announced its plans in 2025, the Treasury said that, thanks to its interventions, “the sector’s total bill will only increase by 4 percent next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week the chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, promised more help for “our pubs and the hospitality sector.” Speaking in Davos earlier this week, she added, “The situation the pubs face is different from other parts of the hospitality sector, but we will be setting out the detail in the next few days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a beer at the Old Thatch, Mr. Lennox said that the protest would most likely continue if the concessions promised by Mr. Starmer applied just to pubs but not to restaurants — as Ms. Reeves hinted she was considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lennox, who runs a total of eight pubs and restaurants, wants the government to cut VAT, a sales tax, from the standard rate of 20 percent to 13 percent for hospitality businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He described how the campaign began after James Fowler, a friend who runs a nearby restaurant called The Larder House, put a sign in his window banning Labour lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some critics question the practicality of the ban. There are 404 Labour members of Parliament, and very few landlords will recognize more than a handful. Others have spoken out against the idea of excluding an entire group of people from places they may want to go with families or friends, or where they would interact with people in the community whom they are meant to represent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a video filmed outside the Larder House, Tom Hayes, the member of Parliament representing the local area of Bournemouth East, made an impassioned argument against the exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s the Christmas season, it’s meant to be the joyful season. But The Larder House and other businesses with a ‘No Labour MPs’ sticker in the window, they are undermining the inclusive culture that business owners locally have helped to nourish,” he said. “My job has just got a million times harder because I can’t go and bang the drum for business with the chancellor if I can’t speak with business leaders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Hayes did not respond to requests for comment. Months before the ban, he had praised Mr. Fowler and several other hospitality business owners during a parliamentary debate on supporting the hospitality sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As entrepreneurs, they are investing time, money and personal risk to create jobs and community hubs,” Mr. Hayes said. “They shoulder costs and were often overlooked in policy discussions over the past 14 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the Old Thatch, there was support for the ban from customers. “Yes, hit them where it hurts — they can’t have a pint,” said Karen Rawlings, 61, who runs a nearby pet care business. “It’s a shame they have to go that far as they are turning away business away, but if it makes a point, fair play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In London, the issue is so sensitive at the Pineapple pub, which Mr. Starmer frequented before he became prime minister, that staff declined to discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the nearby Bull &amp; Gate, Frances Marfleet, 35, who works in health care, said that pubs play an important role in communities. “It’s a big part of our culture in this country,” she said. “If the pub around the corner from your house, that has provided you with joy every weekend for 20 years, suddenly closes, that is really impactful — negatively — on your life, that’s sad.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/23/multimedia/23int-peru-scandal-kjqc/23int-peru-scandal-kjqc-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secret recordings of Peruvian presidents are nothing new. Nor are corruption accusations leading to impeachments. Over the past decade, Peru has had seven presidents, none of whom has managed to hang on for longer than three years. One resigned within a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country’s current president, José Jerí, 39, who presided over the impeachment of his predecessor and who was then installed in her place last October, could join that list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a leaked video released this month, CCTV footage from Dec. 26 shows Mr. Jerí being dropped off by a car belonging to the president’s office and then attempting to cover his face with the hood of his sweatshirt as he entered Xin Yan Restaurant, which is owned by Yang Zhihua, a Chinese businessman who has come under government scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another video leaked a week later shows Mr. Jerí in one of the numerous corner stores that Mr. Yang owns in the capital, Lima. He can be seen shouting into his phone in front of Mr. Yang. Local media had reported that Mr. Yang’s store had been ordered shut down for violating a municipal ordinance. Three days later, the ordinance was struck down by a federal regulatory body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Peruvian law, Mr. Jerí, who has acknowledged the authenticity of the videos, is legally required to log all his official activities and did not disclose his visits to the restaurant and the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under withering questioning from federal lawmakers this week, Mr. Jerí has been defiant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he had known Mr. Yang, who he calls “Johnny,” before he became president. As for the visits, he enjoys Chinese food and happened to pass the store and thought to buy some candy and paintings. (But, he added, “Johnny wouldn’t let me pay because he was being kind to me.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the shouting? It was a call from his press secretary about an unrelated matter that had upset him. He refused to share his phone’s call history with lawmakers and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are normal actions that people, regardless of their position, carry out, but they have been distorted for purposes that the investigations will surely reveal,” he said in Congress on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jerí’s defense has been met with deep skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 20 lawmakers have signed onto motions that, if passed, would result in Mr. Jerí’s impeachment, a number that kept rising on Thursday. Of the 130 members of the lower house, 66 must vote for impeachment for a president to be removed. And on Tuesday, Peru’s prosecutors’ office said it had opened a graft investigation into his meetings with Mr. Yang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Yang has more than a dozen companies in Peru, including a construction firm that has won several contracts from the police, a hydroelectric company that was granted a state concession to build a dam, and a ceramics factory that, according to a national trade association, was built without proper permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times obtained a confidential report on Thursday about Chinese companies accused of corruption in Peru that was drafted by a congressional committee last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it, Mr. Yang was identified as a junior partner in a more than $50 million highway project led by a local subsidiary of China Railway Engineering Corporation that became the subject of an arbitration dispute. The report accuses Mr. Yang’s construction company of conspiring to defraud the Peruvian state by using the economic leverage of large, Chinese state-owned companies to secure contracts for projects that were later abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jerí’s office did not respond to a request for an interview and Mr. Yang could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willax, a conservative cable channel, broadcast a third video of Mr. Jerí with Mr. Yang. It appears to have been recorded by a person wearing a hidden camera, and offers a glimpse of a separate moment at Mr. Yang’s store during Mr. Jerí’s visit there on Jan. 6. It shows members of Mr. Jerí’s team collecting bags of goods from people who appear to be the store’s employees. Someone off-camera says, “This is for the comandante.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru’s Congress is currently on summer break, complicating efforts to summon an extraordinary plenary session to impeach Mr. Jerí, though lawmakers from across the political spectrum have expressed support for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru already has presidential elections scheduled for April. Part of Mr. Jerí’s defense has been to accuse his political opponents of releasing the videos to “alter the electoral process.” Before the scandal broke, Mr. Jerí enjoyed a relatively high approval rating of 51 percent in the latest polling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Peruvians have responded to the mushrooming scandal with jadedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our politicians are all corrupt and they sell themselves to the highest bidder,” said Jacinta Martínez, 45, a landscaper in Lima. “Today it’s the Chinese who are buying them, tomorrow it will be Peruvians or Venezuelans or Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru’s relationship with China has grown increasingly close. More than a decade has passed since China became Peru’s biggest trading partner, and in 2024, Chinese companies completed construction of an enormous port north of Lima — part of Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative. China is the main buyer of Peru’s largest export, copper. Chinese companies are heavily involved in Peruvian infrastructure and telecommunications, and Peruvians can visit China visa-free as tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States has sought to counter Chinese influence in Peru, in large part through forging a closer military partnership. Mr. Jerí has tried to thread the needle by welcoming both Chinese and American investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Mr. Jerí’s brief time in office, President Trump notified Congress that he intended to make Peru a “Major Non-NATO Ally,” a designation that Colombia, Brazil and Argentina also share, and the State Department said Peru had asked to purchase $1.5 billion worth of U.S. equipment and services to support construction of a new naval base near Lima.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, the U.S. Senate approved Mr. Trump’s nomination of Bernie Navarro, a self-described America First champion who has vowed to “root out” growing Chinese influence, as the new ambassador to Peru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Mr. Jerí’s political allies have said that they believe the geopolitical jockeying between the United States and China precipitated the scandal embroiling the president. In an interview with a Peruvian newspaper this week, Prime Minister Ernesto Alvarez said the videos may have been leaked to the media to damage Mr. Jerí for seeking stronger ties with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It could be China because they’re very upset about the” naval base,” he said, “and because we’ve stated transparently that Peru should be an ally of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese and American embassies in Lima did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Mr. Navarro, the incoming U.S. ambassador.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Cuarto Poder, the same outlet that published the video of Mr. Jerí in Mr. Yang’s shop, reported that another Chinese businessman, Ji Wu Xiaodong, who is under investigation for his role in a criminal organization involved in illegal logging, had visited the presidential palace three times since Mr. Jerí took office. Mr. Ji Wu had been ordered held under house arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jerí told lawmakers that Mr. Ji Wu was a friend of Mr. Yang’s and said he did not know Mr. Ji Wu well and that he barely spoke Spanish. Mr. Ji Wu is accredited by Peru’s foreign ministry as an official Chinese-Spanish translator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Peru’s energy regulator, Osinergmin, Mr. Yang’s hydroelectric company, Hidroeléctrica America, has made no progress on building the $24.4 million, 20 megawatt dam as of the end of last year. It is due for completion in March. The company could lose a $244,000 deposit it if does not fulfill the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his testimony before lawmakers this week, Mr. Jerí mentioned two additional, unregistered meetings with Mr. Yang — two more December meals at Mr. Yang’s Xin Yan Restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos of those meetings have yet to emerge, but on a late night TV show on Wednesday, Beto Ortiz, a journalist for Willax claimed that he knew of 19 more videos of Mr. Jerí meeting with Mr. Yang, and teased details from the ones he’d seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his part Mr. Jerí said he is eager to have any videos of him made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully they’ll start airing them,” Mr. Jerí said at a news conference on Thursday afternoon, “so we can verify and get many more clues about who’s behind them and what the links are between them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/23/multimedia/23int-ukraine-ljqv/23int-ukraine-ljqv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian, Russian and American negotiators were expected to hold meetings on Friday in the United Arab Emirates, the latest in a flurry of recent diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine as the fourth anniversary since Russia’s full-scale invasion approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian state news agency Tass reported that a “working group on security issues” was meeting in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, on Friday, confirming an earlier statement by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Russia’s delegation was to be led by Igor Kostyukov, the head of Russia’s military intelligence, Tass reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear when the meetings would start nor how they would play out. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have rarely met directly in past rounds of talks, instead relying on the United States as a mediator. Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s special envoy, and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, were also expected to be in Abu Dhabi, but it was not clear if they would be directly involved in the trilateral talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the table is a revised 20-point peace plan drawn up by Ukraine and the United States, covering a range of issues such as potential territorial arrangements and security guarantees that Kyiv wants to prevent future Russian aggression, as well as plans to rebuild the war-ravaged nation. But the Ukrainian and Russian authorities are still at odds over territory, with Russia demanding a big chunk in an eastern region known as the Donbas, and on security guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Witkoff said on Thursday that the meetings in Abu Dhabi would be working groups handling specific components of the peace plan, including what he called “military-to-military” aspects and “prosperity,” or postwar economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think we’ve got it down to one issue, and we have discussed iterations of that issue, and that means it’s solvable,” he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, without elaborating. “So if both sides want to solve this, we’re going to get it solved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked later by a reporter at Davos about Mr. Witkoff’s comment, Mr. Zelensky said that Russia’s demand to control all of the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, even areas now held by the Ukrainian Army, remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner are expected in Abu Dhabi after meeting late on Thursday with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Tass said that they would be there for a meeting with Russian officials on economic issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuri Ushakov, the foreign policy adviser to Mr. Putin, told reporters after the four-hour meeting with Mr. Putin that it had been “useful in all aspects, both for us and the United States,” according to Tass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Ushakov said that Russia was interested in solving the war “through political and diplomatic means” but that until then it would continue to push on the battlefield “where the Russian Armed Forces hold the strategic initiative,” Tass reported. Ukrainian officials have characterized the fighting as at a near stalemate, with Mr. Zelensky saying on Thursday that both armies were exhausted after four years of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks on Friday also come after a meeting in Davos between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zelensky had said this week that he would attend the gathering in Switzerland only if “real results for Ukraine” were on the table, fueling expectations of a possible breakthrough in the peace talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump said after meeting that their talks had been “good,” and Mr. Zelensky said that they had reached an agreement on U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine after the war. But the leaders offered no details on what these guarantees would entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe they’re at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done,” Mr. Trump said in Davos on Wednesday, referring to the two sides in the Russia-Ukraine peace talks. “And if they don’t, they’re stupid. I don’t want to insult anyone, but you got to get this deal done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/world/00int-iran-cemetery1/00int-iran-cemetery1-facebookJumbo.png" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The families rooted frantically through the piles of corpses, so crammed together that the living had to take care not to step on the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wailing and cursing, they searched the body bags for the number assigned to their loved one for burial — a surreal veneer of bureaucracy imposed onto a chaotic nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the breaking point only came when weary-looking cemetery workers arrived in refrigerated trucks to dump still more corpses on the ground. The body bags landed with sickening thuds in front of onlookers who had come to bury their children, siblings, fathers, mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That moment — it broke people. People couldn’t just watch them throwing the bodies out like that,” said Kiarash, a witness who described the scene this month at Behesht-e Zahra, the largest cemetery in Tehran. “There was a mother lying on her child’s body, begging for help so they wouldn’t throw him somewhere,” Kiarash added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enraged, the crowds began pushing their way into the hallway of the mortuary, cursing Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — a criminal offense in the country — as security forces looked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mothers were crying, shouting,” Kiarash said. “And all the people were shouting things like, ‘Death to Khamenei.’” As Kiarash reached for his phone to film them, he said, security forces quickly stopped him. Others, however, did manage to surreptitiously film and share the protests that day, in videos that have been verified by The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiarash, who, like others interviewed, asked to be identified only by his first name to protect his relatives, gave The New York Times rare, detailed testimony of his experiences during a visit to his family in Iran, which coincided with the anti-government protests that roiled the country for weeks. A violent crackdown unleashed by the government has stifled those demonstrations for now, residents say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staggering toll of this suppression has only begun to emerge — obscured by a government shutdown of the internet and telephone lines for more than a week. Though some communications are slowly being restored, reliable testimony and evidence is emerging piecemeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human rights groups say they have gathered so many individual testimonies of people who witnessed large numbers of bodies collecting at morgues and cemeteries across the country that they expect the death toll to rise far beyond the current estimates of up to 4,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, like Kiarash, three rights groups interviewed by The Times recounted shocking treatment of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of Iran Human Rights, an advocacy group based in Oslo, said that his team had also received witness accounts of bodies being piled on top of one another in Tehran and in the coastal city of Rasht. The group documented testimonies from people who said that they had been forced to search through trucks loaded with bodies to find their loved ones in Tehran and in the northeastern city of Mashhad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mashhad’s poorest neighborhoods, some families recounted being asked to pay impossible sums, sometimes as high as $6,000, to retrieve the bodies of protesters, according to testimonies gathered by the Center for Human Rights in Iran, an organization based in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These people cannot pick up their loved ones’ bodies because they can’t pay that kind of money,” said Hadi Ghaemi, the head of the center. “So the bodies are just being dumped and buried in mass graves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of imposing a “bullet price” on the families of dead dissidents dates to the Islamic Republic’s brutal crackdown on its opponents in the 1980s, when the authorities required a fee to return the bodies of those it executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the evidence that rights groups are now piecing together comes from travelers smuggling out information when they leave Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doctor told The Times that he spirited out videos and testimony from medics in the central city of Isfahan. They shared information about a heavy death toll from that city alone from Jan. 8-10, at the height of the government’s crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now everyone knows someone who was killed,” said the doctor, Mohammed. “The silence imposed on people is not normal — it’s a silence that carries the dust of death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiarash said that he had seen hundreds of bodies during his visit to Behesht-e Zara, on the afternoon of Jan. 10, when he had joined his brother to bury a family friend. The friend, a 41-year-old mother of two, had been shot in the neck at a protest the night before, Kiarash said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mourners at the cemetery started at a reception area, where they received a number that matched the tag on their loved one’s body, Kiarash recounted. Then they made their way toward the mortuary, where cemetery workers perform the Muslim rites of washing the corpses and covering them in a simple white shroud before returning them to their loved ones for burial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the families waited outside the mortuary, they noticed that piles of bodies had been stacked in warehouses nearby, Kiarash said. The sight prompted a frenzy as people broke past the security forces to see if their loved ones were among the piles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was rows upon rows” of bodies, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dian, an Iranian in exile abroad, said that his family had undergone a similar experience to Kiarash’s at the same cemetery. Dian’s father was shot dead at a protest, his family told him, and they buried him at Behesht-e Zahra a day after Kiarash was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dian’s family also described scenes of corpses stacked on top of one another and of cemetery workers insulting the families of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What unnerved Kiarash most, he said, was watching cemetery workers carelessly handling tiny body bags — for children, he guessed, no more than 10 or 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Throwing bodies on top of each other, throwing the children in small bags — they’d get crushed beneath them,” he said. “Every time I say this, my heart breaks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young conscripts overseeing the crowd looked as stunned as the people they were meant to be controlling, Kiarash added: “Some of them were crying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behesht-e Zahra holds a powerful resonance for Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic established after the 1979 revolution, is entombed there. It is also the final resting place of thousands of soldiers who lost their lives in the Iran-Iraq war during the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the authorities bulldozed over a plot there holding many political prisoners, who were executed by the thousands during the ’80s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many rights groups estimate that the toll from Iran’s latest unrest could pass 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footage from Jan. 10, taken at a forensics laboratory a short distance away from Behesht-e Zahra, has also emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos show sobbing crowds searching through bodies piled on the floor as 40-foot-long refrigerator trucks, similar to those Kiarash described, arrive to unload still more dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final indignity is the burial itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arina Moradi, who works for the Norway-based rights group Hengaw, said that the authorities in Tehran had forced her family to pay money to retrieve the body of her cousin, Siavash Shirzad, 38. But they denied Mr. Shirzad’s family the right to bury him in his birth city, Bukan, in western Iran, where his family lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family was forced to bury him in a remote ancestral village instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They paid the money, then they had to agree they would not allow any demonstrations or anything, that they would bury him in silence,” Ms. Moradi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tightly restricting burial rites, Mr. Ghaemi said, is a lesson that the Islamic Republic learned from the 1979 revolution. Then, funerals for protesters and the customary Shiite Muslim memorial services conducted 40 days after a person’s death became critical to maintaining the momentum of demonstrations that ultimately overthrew the shah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reason authorities are so sensitive about where bodies get buried is that they become symbols to the people they live among — and the potential for gatherings at the cemetery that could ignite larger protest,” Mr. Ghaemi said. “They basically deny people the right to mourn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Behesht-e Zahra, Dian said that security guards had accompanied his family to their burial plot to monitor them. In a video shared by the family, the mourners simply chanted, “Honorable one! Honorable one!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiarash said that security guards had rushed his family friends through their final goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One officer was standing over us: ‘You have 30 minutes to do whatever you need,’” Kiarash recalled. The friend was lowered into the grave; the dirt poured over her body was quickly watered to tamp down the dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiarash says that the silence imposed by the government’s crackdown cannot last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The word hatred is not strong enough to signify what people are feeling,” he said. “It’s over.”&lt;/p&gt;
