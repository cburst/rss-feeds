&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22int-theworld-trump-greenland-promo/22int-theworld-trump-greenland-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fate of Greenland has loomed large this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Long before Trump arrived, it was all anyone wanted to talk about. While waiting in line for the many security checks. In the corridors of the sprawling conference center. At the bar after hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ladies’ room, I stumbled across a group of French diplomats touching up their makeup while listing ways Europeans could retaliate. A session titled “Can Europe Defend Itself?” was wildly oversubscribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started with a lot of anticipation for Trump’s speech to the forum, during which he addressed the topic of Greenland, ruling out the use of force, but, seemingly, threatening economic warfare. It ended with Trump calling off those threats, saying on social media that he had reached a framework agreement with Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, “with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement followed a NATO meeting on Wednesday where top military officers discussed a compromise in which Denmark would give the United States sovereignty over small pockets of the island where the United States could build military bases, according to three senior officials familiar with the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, there are still many questions — and many objections to any sort of deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaja Chemnitz, one of the two Greenlandic members of the Danish parliament and a major political figure in Greenland, rejected Trump’s negotiations with NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we are witnessing these days in statements from Trump is completely absurd. NATO has absolutely no mandate to negotiate anything whatsoever without us in Greenland,” she said in a post on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speech in Davos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Trump had taken the main stage at the World Economic Forum, in an auditorium packed with hundreds of elected and business leaders, who patiently listened to him boast about turning the U.S. into the “hottest country” in the world. (Our fact check of the speech is here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he pivoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Would you like me to say a few words about Greenland?” Trump asked. There were a few scattered chuckles. But they quickly turned into an anxious silence, punctuated by audible gasps, as the president lashed out at NATO allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ruled out the use of force, which came as a surprise to some: “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he did seem to threaten economic and security consequences for Europe if the United States wasn’t allowed to purchase the island — only to reverse course hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential deal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we know about a potential deal is very limited. Officials speaking to my colleagues on condition of anonymity compared the idea of giving the U.S. sovereignty over small parts of Greenland to Britain’s military bases in Cyprus, which are regarded as British territory. (The officials said they did not know if that idea had inspired the framework announced by Trump.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a day of whiplash, and the status of negotiations is still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a degree of relief among some European leaders when Trump ruled out an invasion to claim the island, and some Greenlanders and Danes expressed hope at the prospect of a potential solution. Lars Lokke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, told a Danish television channel that the day ended better than it began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This morning we had a president who would not rule out taking Greenland by force. Now he says he will not take Greenland by force,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland — or Iceland, as Trump called it a couple of times — Europe and NATO were not the only targets of Trump in his speech. Here’s a look at everything (and everyone) Trump targeted at Davos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week, Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada received a standing ovation when he declared that the world order had undergone “a rupture.” Carney’s view is widely shared here. And that feeling looks certain to remain, whatever happens next with Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The depth of the rift between Trump and Europe has been on full display. This evening, E.U. leaders will gather in Brussels to try and figure out what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, leaders have gathered in Davos to discuss a shared economic and political future. Yesterday, Trump transformed the forum into the setting of a dramatic rupture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. announced yesterday that it had moved 150 Islamic State fighters from a detention facility in northeastern Syria to Iraq and that it might eventually move up to 7,000 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transfer followed concerns that thousands of former ISIS fighters and their family members could escape from detention as the Syrian government and Kurdish-led forces vie for control of the area. The 150 fighters were taken to an unspecified “secure location in Iraq,” the U.S. Central Command said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kurdish-led militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., agreed on Sunday to hand over control of the prisons to the Syrian government. The transition has been rocky. In recent days, detainees escaped from at least one prison amid skirmishes. Chaos appeared to break out after S.D.F. forces abruptly withdrew from the Al Hol detention camp, which houses tens of thousands of family members of ISIS fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our economics reporters — based in New York, London, Brussels, Berlin, Hong Kong and Seoul — are digging into every aspect of the tariffs causing global turmoil. They are joined by dozens of reporters writing about the effects on everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S.D.F. was the U.S.’s closest ally in Syria for more than a decade. That alliance is now disintegrating as the U.S. throws its weight behind the new Syrian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli forces killed at least 11 people in Gaza, including three Palestinian journalists who the Israeli military said were flying a drone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan restarted a reactor at a large nuclear complex, nearly 15 years after the Fukushima meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince Harry became emotional as he testified in London’s High Court about what he called intrusive news coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Han Duck-soo, the former prime minister of South Korea, was sentenced to 23 years for collaborating with the imposition of martial law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artificial island has a gigantic shopping mall without shops, a theme park without visitors, high-rise housing blocks without residents and beaches too dangerous for swimming. My colleagues paid a visit to the project, a symbol of China’s never-ending real estate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the cheese that drew Canadian customers across the U.S. border to Willey’s Store in Greensboro, Vermont. Alongside Americans, they shopped for Withersbrook Blue, a recent winner at the World Cheese Awards, and creamy Harbison, which has woodsy notes derived from its spruce-bark wrapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21int-greenland-reax01-photo-cqpb/21int-greenland-reax01-photo-cqpb-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Greenlanders and Danes expressed relief and even hope after President Trump suddenly signaled on Wednesday night that a solution had been reached with NATO that would avoid a confrontation over Greenland. But some Greenlandic politicians said it was wrong that they had not been involved in the talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his speech in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would not use force to acquire Greenland. Later he wrote in a post on social media that he had “a very productive meeting” with the head of NATO and “formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland has been part of the Danish Kingdom for more than 300 years and Danish commentators were buoyed by the developments even though the details about the deal had not been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks more promising than anything I have seen in weeks,” said Mikkel Runge Olesen, a researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies in Copenhagen.“It is certainly a decisive new development,” he said. “The Danish reactions right now are cautiously optimistic. I think people are holding back because of how quickly a seemingly positive development has come to nothing before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Aaja Chemnitz, one of the two Greenlandic members of the Danish parliament and a major political figure in Greenland, rejected what Mr. Trump said about the “future deal” with NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we are witnessing these days in statements from Trump is completely absurd,” she said in a post that appeared on Facebook. “NATO has absolutely no mandate to negotiate anything whatsoever without us in Greenland.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing about us, without us,” she said. “There is total confusion being created.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the speech earlier in the day at the World Economic Forum, Mr. Trump kept up his insistence that the United States should take over the island, and he provided a curious history lesson. He said that after the Germans invaded Denmark in 1940, the United States rushed in to defend Greenland. That part is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what isn’t was Mr. Trump’s insistence that after the war, the United States somehow “gave it back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not true at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark never relinquished sovereignty of the island, the largest in the world. Instead, the Danish ambassador in Washington, cut off from Copenhagen, took it upon himself to strike a defense agreement for Greenland that allowed American forces access to defend it. The expectation was that Denmark would regain control of the island after the war, which it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That initial agreement, made in 1941, paved the way for a sweeping Danish-American defense pact 10 years later that most analysts and European officials, especially the Danes, say is robust enough for Mr. Trump to accomplish his security goals. In his speech, he reiterated his argument that the only way to protect Greenland is for the United States to own it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talked about his plan for a “golden dome” missile defense program that would necessitate American control of Greenland. He even spent a little time explaining that Greenland’s glittering minerals, which he acknowledged were buried under “hundreds of feet of ice,” weren’t the real attraction, but that it was all about security, security, security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speech was carried live on TV in Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anso Lauritzen, the owner of sled dog center in western Greenland, said, “I couldn’t help myself — I had to watch.” Her impression was that the speech was headed in the right direction, at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But then he just keeps talking,” Ms. Lauritzen said about Mr. Trump. “We really don’t know what he’s thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to be part of America,” she added on Wednesday afternoon. “I don’t want to follow their rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by night, after reading Mr. Trump’s new comment, she said, “Is he acting alone? We’re trying to read all the media, but we can’t see what it’s about. What do you think they’ve agreed on? That’s all I want to know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark’s foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Wednesday that the day ended better than it began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This morning we had a president who would not rule out taking Greenland by force. Now he says he will not take Greenland by force,” Mr. Rasmussen told Danish television channel, TV 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rasmussen said he had spoken briefly with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and would receive a more detailed briefing on the meeting later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the conversation, the use of force is off the table, Mr. Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That creates a small sliver of hope,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland’s government said it would comment on Mr. Trump’s remarks on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuno Fencker, a member of the Greenlandic parliament who has been open to a closer relationship with the United States, said he was upset that all these talks were going on between Mr. Trump and NATO about Greenland but without Greenland’s input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenland should be directly involved in what is going on,” he said. “That is what we want.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21int-davos-scene01-photo-bqgm/21int-davos-scene01-photo-bqgm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As President Trump threatened to upend some of the central pillars of the Western order on Wednesday, during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, some in the crowd of elites sat speechless. Others groaned. A few gasped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president and a key power broker in Europe, stood up ashen-faced at the end of the speech that took aim at people like him: the leaders of the Western political and economic elite. As others made for the exits, Mr. Stubb approached Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina — seeking to learn more, Mr. Graham later said, about Mr. Trump and the United States’ position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everybody in Europe is concerned,” Mr. Graham, an ally of Mr. Trump, said dismissively after speaking to Mr. Stubb. “They’re concerned when they get up and when they go to bed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction from Mr. Stubb, who declined to comment, embodied a broader sense of shock across the conference, a talking shop for political and economic leaders. For decades, like-minded politicians, businesspeople, investors and celebrities have gathered in Davos to discuss a shared economic and political future. But for more than an hour on Wednesday in one of the main speaking halls, Mr. Trump transformed the forum into the setting of a dramatic rupture between the West’s leading player and its increasingly distant allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mocking European leaders for days, Mr. Trump flew thousands of miles to this snowy mountainside to launch into a verbal assault against the Western alliance, the values of its leaders and societies, and the framework of world trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day Mr. Trump had rescinded some of his worst threats, saying that he had reached a tentative framework with NATO over the future of Greenland, which he wants to buy from Denmark, and withdrawn threats to impose new tariffs on allies that opposed U.S. ownership of Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some European leaders expressed a glimmer of hope over the moves, they did little to salve the deep fear among Davos’s browbeaten guests that the United States could no longer be relied on as an ally. Earlier in the day the group had weathered insult after insult from Mr. Trump about their approach to trade, the environment and immigration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scattered chuckling fell to an anxious silence before turning into audible gasps as Mr. Trump used his speech to once again demand ownership of Greenland, lash out against NATO and vaguely threaten economic warfare if the European leaders did not acquiesce to his demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders sat stunned as Mr. Trump insulted their governments and questioned their reliability as allies. Others grimaced as Mr. Trump claimed the European nations and Canada owed the United States a debt. Some even scrambled after the speech to find and question current and former U.S. officials about the president’s thinking and the future of the United States as a trustworthy partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Gordon, a former national security adviser for Kamala Harris who attended the speech, said foreign officials approached him during the summit asking if Mr. Trump’s position was now “permanent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is this America?” Mr. Gordon said European officials asked him on Wednesday. “And is the post-World War II era definitively over — or is there any hope it comes back?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was also a growing acceptance that a new world order is now emerging, right under their noses at a conference that for years was so emblematic of the old frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They accept that under Trump this is a new world,” said Mr. Gordon. “No one can deny that and even the Europeans who have been in denial now accept.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his speech, Mr. Trump crystallized an idea central to that new world — a searing disregard for the post-World War II world order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump suggested the European allies owed him Greenland. He said that without the United States’ efforts in World War II, “you’d all be speaking German and a little Japanese perhaps,” prompting moans from the crowd. And while he said he would not use force to obtain Greenland — prompting some to breathe a sigh of relief — he did continued to frame Greenland as a debt that needed to be paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can say yes and we will be very appreciative or you can say no and we will remember,” Mr. Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump took particular aim at Switzerland, the country hosting the summit, stunning some Swiss officials. “They’re only good because of us,” Mr. Trump said of the Swiss as he celebrated his sweeping tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was really astonished,” said Elisabeth Schneider-Schneiter, a member of the Swiss Parliament. “We are the hosts, we are the guarantee for his security from the airport to Davos, with public tax money spent, and I was convinced that we had resolved the trade issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the attendees liked his speech or not — and many seemed to loathe it — Mr. Trump’s appearance was the talk of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the hall where Mr. Trump spoke, companies held watch parties to view his speech. Attendees tried to rearrange meetings in order not to miss it. On the promenade, people live streamed his remarks while walking, before others later recounted the bombshells in the speech. “Are we even important?” one asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet others spoke of a disaster averted, particularly after Mr. Trump said he was not interested in using force to acquire Greenland. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said he later encountered some European officials who told him “it could’ve been worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s remarkable when we’ve gotten to a place where we’re saying it could’ve been worse because an American president took off the table the use of force against a NATO ally,” Mr. Coons said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here and there, you could find warm support for the president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his speech, Mr. Trump spoke at a reception for business executives, financial chiefs and cryptocurrency leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We got great reviews,” Mr. Trump told the crowd. “I can’t believe it, but we got good reviews of that speech. Usually they say he’s a horrible dictator type person, but sometimes you need a dictator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes later, as Mr. Trump finished speaking, he was met with loud applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once Mr. Trump revoked some of his biggest threats on Wednesday evening, the mood across the conference edged closer to relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Mr. Trump’s decision to pull back on tariffs, some attendees texted their peers a single word: “Taco!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term is short for Trump Always Chickens Out, a tongue-in-cheek quip adopted by some critics to describe Mr. Trump’s tendency to threaten sweeping tariffs, only to pull them back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’ve lived through so many cycles of this,” Mr. Gordon said. “You live to fight another day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21dc-board-peace-mkft/21dc-board-peace-mkft-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the proposed charter of the “Board of Peace” that the United States sent to national capitals in recent weeks, one man has the power to veto decisions, approve the agenda, invite members, dissolve the board entirely and designate his own successor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name is spelled out in Article 3.2: “Donald J. Trump shall serve as inaugural chairman.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Trump, then peace,” Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, one of President Trump’s closest allies in Europe, wrote on Facebook on Sunday after Mr. Trump invited him to join the board. “We have, of course, accepted this honorable invitation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel, Belarus, Pakistan and several more countries also said they were joining, ahead of a signing ceremony planned for Thursday in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many officials and experts in international affairs were stunned by the breadth of the initiative, the latest example of Mr. Trump taking apart the American-built, post-World War II international system and building a new one, with himself at the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a direct assault on the United Nations,” said Marc Weller, a Cambridge international law professor who specializes in peace negotiations and has worked closely with the global body. “This initiative is likely to be seen as a takeover of the world order by one individual in his own image.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.N. Security Council itself endorsed the creation of a Board of Peace in November in a resolution welcoming the U.S.-brokered peace plan to end Israel’s war in Gaza. According to that resolution, the board is to function as a “transitional administration” through 2027 to oversee the redevelopment of Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in unveiling the Board of Peace in the last week, the Trump administration has cast Gaza as only a part of what the new institution would do. While its powers are not defined, its mission would overlap with the United Nations’ aim of maintaining international peace and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trump has proven himself a pretty capable and aggressive leader,” said Fred Fleitz, the chief of staff of the National Security Council for part of Mr. Trump’s first term. “This is taking advantage of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed charter, seen by The New York Times, says the board would seek to “secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s peace envoy, who was named as a member of the group’s “executive board,” told CNBC that more than 20 countries had already agreed to join and that the Board of Peace would be “a great group of leaders coming together” in “sharing opinion to achieve peace.” He listed Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Sudan and Syria as among the places in need of “bridging relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wish the United Nations could do more,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday. “I wish we didn’t need a Board of Peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he wanted the board to replace the United Nations, Mr. Trump said that it “might.” He added: “I believe you got to let the U.N. continue because the potential is so great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations itself has sought to play down any tensions. A spokesman, Farhan Haq, told reporters that the U.N. “has coexisted alongside any number of organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Trump administration’s ambiguous messaging about the Board of Peace has added to the head-spinning nature of an extraordinary January in American foreign policy. The U.S. attack on Venezuela, the threats of strikes on Iran and Mr. Trump’s demands to take over Greenland have all sent the message that the United States is seeking to exert its global power in a newly unilateral way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Peace, with its sprawling mission and with Mr. Trump as its long-term chairman, appeared to be an attempt at building an institution to codify the American dominance that the president envisions. Norway, Sweden and France have already said they do not intend to join. The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said his country would say “no to creating an organization as it has been presented, which would replace the United Nations,” according to The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The bond of trust has been broken” between the United States and its allies, said R. Nicholas Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, China and elsewhere. “The overreach by the administration on Greenland and the miscalculation they have made has really brought about a different European view and Canadian view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump withdrew from 66 international organizations that his administration deemed “wasteful, ineffective, and harmful.” He has suggested that he sees his board filling some of that vacuum — offering the world a more assertive brand of American engagement, personified by Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Peace “will be established as a new international organization,” Mr. Trump wrote in his letter to Mr. Orban, which the Hungarian prime minister posted online. The organization’s charter says in its opening line that “durable peace” requires “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Fleitz, who is now at the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank close to the administration, said the decision to include Russia and China among the invited members reflected the intended “broad-based” nature of the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They want to reduce the possibility that various countries will try to sabotage it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia and China have veto power on the U.N. Security Council, so they would be likely to look askance at any weakening of the body. But both have also tried to curry favor with Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has said it was invited but not whether it would accept. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also stopped short of accepting the invitation, saying his foreign ministry needed to analyze the matter. But in an example of how countries can try to use Mr. Trump’s ambitions to advance their own interests, Mr. Putin added that Russia was prepared to contribute $1 billion to the board — as long as the money comes out of the Russian assets that were frozen in the West after Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft charter for the board stipulates the $1 billion fee for countries that seek to stay on for longer than a three-year term. A U.S. official said on Tuesday that the board “will implement the highest financial controls and oversight mechanisms” for the cash it collects, and that “funds will sit only in approved accounts at reputable banks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. official confirmed that Mr. Trump could play a central role in the board even after leaving the presidency. Mr. Trump can hold the chairmanship “until he resigns it,” the official said. “A future U.S. president, however, may choose to appoint or designate the United States’ representative to the board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Weller, the peace negotiations specialist, argued that the expected $1 billion contributions could further sap funding from the U.N., whose agencies were told by the United States in December that they needed to “adapt, shrink or die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said that the central personal role envisioned for Mr. Trump was unlike any other agreement he had seen in his experience in international affairs. It was, he said, unlikely to represent a sustainable pathway to world peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Peace in the world requires a broad, international consensus,” Mr. Weller said. “That can hardly be created through a new institution that is entirely dependent on the will of one man.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21assad-hvmj/21assad-hvmj-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rifaat al-Assad, who as a paramilitary leader in 1982 put down an uprising against his brother, Syria’s ruler Hafez al-Assad, killing up to 40,000 and earning him the nickname “the butcher of Hama,” died on Monday. He was 88.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His death was reported by his son Siwar al-Assad on social media. Voice of Emirates, a news site in Dubai, where Mr. Assad had been living in exile, reported that he died there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than 50 years, many of them spent in cosseted exile, Rifaat al-Assad was an integral part of the family that ruled Syria with an iron fist — sometimes agitating from the inside for more power, and sometimes from the outside, as the leader of failed movements to gain dominance in his country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His notorious place in Syria’s history was assured by his command over the large-scale massacre of civilians in Hama in 1982, a model later followed by his nephew Bashar for effectively suppressing dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Assad was the commander of an elite unit, the paramilitary Defense Forces, when his brother sent him to crush an uprising in the west-central Syrian city of Hama in February 1982. Hama was in the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood, bitterly opposed to the secularist Ba’ath Party regime of Mr. Assad’s older brother Hafez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revolt, the most serious challenge Hafez faced during his harsh 30-year reign, was crushed with merciless brutality in a siege that lasted nearly a month.&lt;/p&gt;

We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rifaat al-Assad’s forces began an indiscriminate bombardment of residential neighborhoods in Hama on Feb. 2, deploying the Syrian Air Force and ground troops “without distinguishing between civilians and combatants,” according to a report by the Syrian Network for Human Rights on the massacre’s 40th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The regime forces carried out deliberate killings of wounded people, targeting entire families, including women, children and young people,” the report added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The massacre was covered up by the Hafez al-Assad regime, and no official death toll was ever established. It created the precedent for Bashar, who faced his own civilian uprising in 2011 and who scrupulously followed his uncle’s example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, with Rifaat al-Assad long since living a life of luxurious exile in Europe, Swiss prosecutors indicted him for war crimes and crimes against humanity, under their country’s broad remit to pursue international war criminals on the basis of individuals’ residence, however brief, in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the commander of operations at Hama, Mr. Assad “ordered murders, acts of torture, acts of cruelty, and illegal imprisonments,” the indictment stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He never faced a day in prison for commanding the Hama massacre, nor for illicitly accumulating a vast portfolio of sumptuous properties in Europe and the Caribbean with money stolen from the Syrian state, with an estimated value of more than $800 million. In addition to a palatial dwelling on Paris’s ultra-fashionable Avenue Foch, he and members of family owned villas on Spain’s Costa del Sol, a 110-acre estate outside Paris and a $15 million Georgian townhouse in the elegant Mayfair area of London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, a French court sentenced Rifaat al-Assad to four years in jail for “crimes of exceptional gravity,” related to his large-scale embezzlement, and ordered his properties to be seized. His nephew Bashar, taking pity on his uncle, allowed him to flee back to Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Assad’s visits back had been rare ever since his abortive attempt to overthrow his brother Hafez in March 1984, two years after the Hama massacre. Mr. Assad had helped his brother, a military officer, take power in 1970, but relations between the two had always been guarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizing his chance while his brother was ill in the winter of 1984, Rifaat deployed 55,000 members of his Defense Forces around Damascus, intent on acquiring power. They were confronted by troops loyal to Hafez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subsequent meeting of the two brothers, in the presence of their elderly mother, who was flown in from their native village for the occasion, defused the crisis. “Here I am. I am the regime,” Hafez reportedly said to his younger brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rifaat agreed to stand down in exchange for being designated “vice-president,” a title that turned out to be meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long period of comfortable exile began, first in Switzerland and then in France. In 1986, President François Mitterrand of France, convinced that Mr. Assad would one day succeed his brother, and wanting to keep him close — Syria had been a French protectorate before World War II — awarded him the Legion of Honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Hafez died in 2000, Rifaat asserted his right to succeed him but was rebuffed by Syria’s ruling Baathist party in favor of his 34-year-old nephew Bashar, who until then had been a relatively unobtrusive ophthalmologist. Rifaat was barred from attending his brother’s funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bashar fell with unexpected haste in 2024, Rifaat tried to escape Syria via a Russian air base in the country, but the Russian military there refused to allow him in. He fled to Lebanon, reportedly crossing a river on the back of an associate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rifaat al-Assad was born in the village of al-Qardaha, in western Syria, on Aug. 22, 1937, to a family of the Alawite minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He studied political science and economics at Damascus University, joined the military after the Ba’ath Party seized power in March 1963, and took command of the Defense Companies, which the publication Middle East Intelligence Bulletin called the “Praetorian Guards of the Assad regime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was as their leader that he first made his name in Syria, directing them in a massacre of Muslim Brotherhood inmates at the Tadmore prison in June 1980, in which 600 to 1,000 of them were killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete information on his survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Assad was known to have married four times, in polygamous marriages, lastly to Lina al-Khayyir. His children include his daughters Tumadir and Tamadhin and another son, Ribal al-Assad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His son Siwar, announcing his father’s death, denounced what he called “a flood of lies and calumnies” emanating from “detractors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22int-brazil-film01-photo-qjwc/22int-brazil-film01-photo-qjwc-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even shielded by dark sunglasses, Tânia Maria de Medeiros Filha can’t step outside these days without fans fawning over her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wherever I go, people recognize me,” the 79-year-old actress said. “It’s marvelous,” she added. “But it hasn’t gone to my head.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Ms. Madeiros doesn’t have a decades-long career as a leading lady of Brazilian cinema. In fact, she has just a few credits to her name, some of them as an extra. Before setting foot on a film set for the very first time a few years ago, she spent her days weaving rugs in her sleepy hometown in Brazil’s northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Tânia Maria, as she is commonly known, is causing a major cinematic stir at home and abroad with a show-stealing performance in Brazil’s latest buzzy film, “The Secret Agent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a modest but captivating 11 minutes onscreen, Tânia Maria has drawn praise from international film critics, grabbed newspaper headlines and amassed more than 100,000 followers on social media in just months. And the movie that has catapulted her to fame overnight is now widely expected to earn an Oscar nomination on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tânia Maria, for one, chalks up the frenzy to her authenticity in a role not far from her real-life persona. “I think it’s because of my simplicity,” she said in an interview this month, in between takes for her next film. “I am that person. I am Mrs. Sebastiana.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Secret Agent,” a slow-burning political thriller set in the late 1970s, tells the tale of a former professor, played by a melancholic Wagner Moura, who finds himself on the run from Brazil’s brutal military dictatorship. When he seeks refuge in a safe house in the city of Recife, he is welcomed by his hostess: Mrs. Sebastiana, played by Tânia Maria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clad in floral dresses and puffing on a cigarette, Tânia Maria portrays the housemother to a group of political refugees defying the regime. With authority and charisma, she plays matchmaker among her guests and plots their escapes from the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film’s international success, a year after “I’m Still Here” earned Brazil’s first-ever Oscar for best international feature film, has spurred a fresh wave of excitement in Latin America’s largest nation. It also is shining a spotlight on the culture, folklore and dialects of the northeast, where the movie is set, inspiring pride and appreciation in the rich heritage of a region long overlooked in much of Brazilian cinema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tânia Maria, in her role as the straight-talking grandmother aiding strangers in trouble, embodies a familiar and beloved part of Brazil’s cultural identity, said Aline Diniz, a film commentator and television presenter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve all met a Tânia Maria in our lives here,” Ms. Diniz said. “She is old-school Brazil at its core. She just feels like a hug.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tânia Maria got her start in cinema by chance, when Kleber Mendonça Filho, the director of the “Secret Agent” and one of Brazil’s most renowned filmmakers, came to her hometown to shoot another movie in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She noticed the commotion in town and wandered over to the set, where she learned the film crew was looking for local talent and paying the equivalent of $10 per day. “And that was that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tânia Maria quickly won over Mr. Mendonça Filho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She was supposed to be an extra in the film,” he said in an interview. “But she caught my attention so much that I suggested giving her a line.” Tânia Maria’s single line in that production, “Bacurau,” quickly drew widespread attention on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Mr. Mendonça Filho started writing “The Secret Agent,” he says he couldn’t help but think of Tânia Maria as he conceived of her character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She’s someone who is very charismatic,” he said. “Direct, tough and, at the same time, good-humored,” he added. “She reminds me of all the older ladies I’ve ever known.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having no formal acting training, Tânia Maria is a natural on set, according to Mr. Mendonça Filho. “This is someone who nails it every single time,” he said. “She is a grand actress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her acting chops have not gone unnoticed. In a pre-Oscar roundup last month, Variety highlighted her performance in a glowing review. And, in an annual list of memorable film appearances, The New York Times cheekily listed Tânia Maria’s few minutes onscreen as the “best cigarette acting” of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actress said she is working on kicking that habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before, I used to smoke three packs a day,” she told Brazil’s biggest newsmagazine program this month. “If you want to hire Tânia Maria now, it’s without the cigarettes. I can put a cigarette in my hand, but I won’t smoke it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attention garnered by the film, and by Tânia Maria herself, have set off hopes that Brazil could win Hollywood’s most prestigious prize for a second year in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Sunday evening this month, film lovers trickled into a Rio de Janeiro movie theater for a watch party to see whether “The Secret Agent” would win an award at the Golden Globes, after racking up accolades at film festivals across Europe, the United States and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some were also there to win their own prize: being crowned the best Tânia Maria impersonator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The half-dozen contestants were mostly clad in florals and oversized glasses. All puffed theatrically on make-believe cigarettes, as they snapped photos in front of a life-size cardboard poster for “The Secret Agent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m here representing our new icon,” said Marta Torres, 44, as she held up a massive cigarette made of construction paper. She was especially moved by Tânia Maria’s performance, she added, because she herself is from Brazil’s northeast. “I feel so represented,” she said. “There is something so Brazilian in her, and in the film.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Francisca Oliveira, 80, the actress she was imitating served as an inspiration. “She’s brilliant,’’ she said. “She has so much presence, she’s just so authentic and real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before the contest kicked off inside one of the auditoriums, Tânia Maria appeared on a towering screen. “Just stopping by to wish you all the best,” she said in a video to her fans, as they cheered and filmed her message on their phones. “Have a blast!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each contestant then strutted across a small stage, delivering a favorite line from Mrs. Sebastiana, the character Tânia Maria plays. The winner was announced: a 9-year-old boy in floral print and dark glasses eerily similar to those worn by the actress in the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He couldn’t eat all day, he was so excited,” his mother, Carolina Machado, 48, said. “He loves her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the contest, the lights dimmed and the Golden Globes ceremony began. About an hour in, as the show cut to a commercial break, the smiling face of Tânia Maria, beamed from the screen again, toasting with the frosty beer being advertised. More thunderous applause followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When “The Secret Agent” was announced as the winner in two categories — best film in a foreign language and best actor in a motion picture drama — the room erupted in cheers that could have rivaled any World Cup final. Some jumped out of their seats, embracing each other and wiping away tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Tânia Maria, the frenzy around “The Secret Agent” has marked the high point of her short career as an actress. But she certainly doesn’t plan to retire anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not old, you know?” she said. “I’m just getting started.”&lt;/p&gt;

Europe Must Decide What to Do About It.</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/europe/trump-rift-europe.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22int-europe-assess01-photo-gqmv/22int-europe-assess01-photo-gqmv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depth of the rift between President Trump and Europe was on full display on Wednesday as Mr. Trump delivered remarks in Davos, Switzerland, airing his disdain for Europe’s immigration policies, its regulations and its strident unwillingness to give him Greenland, which he insists America must own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, Europe has been looking to find a diplomatic answer to de-escalate the crisis. Hope for such an off ramp came late Wednesday, when Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social to announce that he and Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, were working on a deal that could resolve the dispute over Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. He suggested that tariffs he had previously threatened to impose on European nations starting Feb. 1 would no longer kick in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither he nor NATO provided any details of what such that framework might look like, and there is no guarantee that such a deal will be finished. A member of the Danish parliament from Greenland called the deal into question in a social media post, saying it had created “total confusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dust had not yet settled Wednesday night. But one thing was clear. Mr. Trump’s comments throughout the day underscored just how little the United States and Europe — long the closest of allies — now have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we may no longer be literally staring down the barrel of a gun on the trans-Atlantic relationship, we are still in a very rocky place,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are fundamentally at odds, in a way that can only reflect the very different values between most governments in Europe and the Trump administration,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders, many of them shocked by Mr. Trump’s threats to take over the sovereign territory of an E.U. member and NATO ally, must still come together on what they might or should do if Mr. Trump changes his position again — and about the trans-Atlantic relationship more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening, leaders from across the 27-nation European Union will gather in Brussels to discuss the perilous state of Europe’s relationship with the United States. They may discuss the contours of the plan Mr. Trump alluded to in his social media post. They will debate how they should approach this new and more hostile era, especially when Russia is still waging war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump had announced over the weekend that he intended to apply levies of 10 percent on several European nations that have recently sent troops to Greenland as part of a NATO exercise. Although he has suspended those tariffs, it is unclear if that will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mere possibility set off a panicked flurry. European ambassadors met for an emergency gathering on Sunday to discuss the development, and many European leaders called Mr. Trump directly. Thursday’s summit was called in response to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion is likely to touch on the state of play after the gathering in Davos, including Mr. Rutte’s discussion with Mr. Trump. Leaders will also vet what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the tariff issue is resolved, and even if the Greenland matter is resolved, Mr. Trump’s aggressive push for the island — and his language about Europe in recent days and weeks — have exposed a serious rupture forming between the partners that is far from healed. Europe is grappling with a changed reality, after decades in which it relied on a stable relationship with the United States for both trade and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The shift in the international order is not only seismic — but it is permanent,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said on Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior European official, speaking anonymously to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters, appealed for a bit of calm, noting that Mr. Trump recently threatened to sanction any country that did business with Iran, but has not done so until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson, he suggested, was to keep Europe’s powder dry, not to overreact and escalate needlessly with a key ally, and push for diplomacy. To that end, he said the bloc should be ready to retaliate — to have leverage — but should not react unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union already has a 93 billion euro, or $107 billion, list of U.S. goods prepared that it is poised to hit with retaliatory tariffs after Feb. 6. The list was finalized last year in response to Mr. Trump’s earlier trade war, and it will snap into place automatically unless E.U. officials take proactive moves to suspend it — making it a natural first step, should retaliation prove necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump also had his usual harsh words for NATO during his speech on Wednesday, asserting that NATO allies would not come to the aid of the United States if attacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the only time Article V of the NATO treaty, the commitment to collective defense, was ever invoked was to aid the United States after it was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NATO troops fought alongside American soldiers in Afghanistan for a decade, and Denmark itself had more soldiers die per capita in Afghanistan than America did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, at Davos, Mr. Rutte, the NATO secretary general, praised Mr. Trump for pushing member states to spend more on their own defense, which has strengthened the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked if he could imagine NATO without the United States, he said simply, “No.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States “is by far the most powerful nation on earth, and the president of the United States is the leader of the free world,” he said, adding, “And you cannot envision NATO without the leader of the free world being an integral part of that organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rutte also touched on the most pressing security issue for Europeans, which is Russian aggression against Ukraine — right on the E.U.’s borders — and not an icy island in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The risk here is that we focus, of course, on Greenland, because we have to make sure that issue gets solved in an amicable way,” Mr. Rutte said on a panel in Davos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ukraine should be our No. 1 priority, and then we can discuss all the issues, including Greenland,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
