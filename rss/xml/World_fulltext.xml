&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/multimedia/17int-syria-raqqa-ktcm/17int-syria-raqqa-ktcm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syrian government troops advanced into Kurdish-held territory in the north on Saturday, seizing key towns and sparking fresh clashes that threatened to unravel a once-promising political agreement meant to reunify a fractured nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escalation follows intense fighting earlier this month between the government and the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., a Kurdish-led militia that is backed by the United States, and it raises the prospect of a government push toward Raqqa, the largest city administered by Kurdish authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raqqa became globally emblematic of the Syrian conflict after the Islamic State seized it in 2014, and declared it the capital of its self-proclaimed caliphate. The city was devastated during the U.S.-backed campaign to defeat the jihadist group and has since remained under S.D.F. control, with a small American military presence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the fall of the dictator Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, Kurdish-led forces have been hesitant to submit to the new government’s authority. For nearly a year, the two sides have engaged in negotiations over the integration of Kurdish military and civilian institutions into the new Syrian state, but those talks have stalled in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewed fighting has sharpened concerns in Washington about the prospect of a broader confrontation between Kurdish-led forces and Damascus, which could destabilize U.S.-led efforts to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State and endanger American troops still stationed in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military advance on Saturday came hours after Kurdish fighters withdrew from several positions east of the major city of Aleppo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S.D.F. announced the withdrawal after President Ahmed al-Sharaa of Syria issued a decree on Friday affirming the rights of Kurdish Syrians. The announcement was widely seen as an attempt to ease tensions after government forces struck S.D.F. positions in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation quickly deteriorated on Saturday as each side accused the other of violating the terms of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of U.S. military forces in the Middle East, urged Syrian government forces, in a statement on Saturday, to “cease any offensive actions” in areas near Aleppo. The U.S. special envoy to Syria, Thomas J. Barrack Jr., also met in northern Iraq on Saturday with Mazloum Abdi, the S.D.F.’s commander, and Masoud Barzani, the veteran Iraqi Kurdish leader, as Washington worked to avoid a broader confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchanges of fire have been reported in several of towns and villages as government forces said they were advancing through oil-rich areas toward the strategic town of Tabqa, a move that would place government troops roughly 30 miles from Raqqa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewed clashes capped weeks of violence that have amounted to some of the most intense fighting since the end of the civil war in December 2024, when Mr. al-Sharaa’s coalition of rebel groups ousted the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/multimedia/17int-greenland-protests-promo/17int-greenland-protests-mtzv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time since President Trump renewed his campaign to take over Greenland, people across the Arctic island braved the freezing temperatures and took to the icy streets on Saturday in coordinated protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demonstrators waved Greenlandic flags, as some people openly cried in the rain, at a protest in Nuuk, the capital, when Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen suddenly appeared. The crowd roared as he climbed onto a snowbank to raise a flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We said it last year, and we will keep saying it: We are not for sale,” said Isak Berthelsen, a 43-year-old electrician from Nuuk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeating the message, he added, did not feel exhausting. “It’s energizing,” he said. “It shows that we are strong enough to say no, and that we have our own voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Nielsen led several hundred Greenlanders as they marched through the capital’s center, a rare sight in a city of fewer than 20,000 residents. Some carried hand-painted signs reading “No means no,” “Greenland Is Already Great” and “Yankee, go home!” Others displayed harsher — and cruder — slogans aimed at the U.S. administration. Demonstrations were also held in Aasiaat, Qaqortoq and Ilulissat, with rallies taking place in Copenhagen and other Danish cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many protesters said on Saturday that they had reached a breaking point after Mr. Trump repeatedly suggested that the United States would take Greenland, a semiautonomous part of Denmark, “one way or the other,” and that it would happen “whether they like it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of unrest inside people right now,” said Kristian Johansen, 67, a retired carpenter who lives in Nuuk and helped organize the demonstration. “Every new statement makes it worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign ministers from Denmark and Greenland had traveled to Washington days earlier to defuse the situation in a meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, the White House said the talks would move into a phase focused on the “technicalities of acquiring Greenland.” Danish and Greenlandic officials rejected that characterization, saying they had agreed to continue discussions aimed at addressing American security concerns without a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on Saturday, Mr. Trump announced that he would impose new tariffs on Denmark — and several other NATO countries that have expressed solidarity with it — unless they relent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowd in Nuuk included teachers, children, fishermen and retirees, many wrapped in Greenlandic flags, joining the protest in hopes of conveying their anger, frustration and fear to Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know how else you talk to someone who doesn’t understand anything at all,” said Angu Kristensen, 63.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls and interviews conducted over recent weeks have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose becoming part of the United States. Instead, most say they prefer to remain a self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, where they enjoy a high standard of living and broad autonomy over domestic affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark,” Mr. Nielsen said on Tuesday in a joint news conference with Denmark’s prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protesters from across Denmark packed Copenhagen’s City Hall Square before marching to the U.S. Embassy on Saturday, with some carrying signs of solidarity with Greenland, like “This Land Is Their Land.” Others directed their messages at the Trump administration, including “Make America Smart Again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanne Dueholm, 61, had come into the city from her horse farm in Lejre with her husband and daughter, sporting hats that said, “Make America Go Away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When Trump began making threats, I thought: He is just like Putin — he needs another country, so he takes it,” she said, adding, “but you can’t have that mind-set in a democratic world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, NATO allies in Europe, including France, Germany and several Scandinavian countries, deployed personnel to Greenland as part of Danish-led exercises, in a gesture of solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It shows that we have support from Europe and NATO, and that we are not standing alone,” said Anso Lauritzen, 49, an organizer of the protest in Ilulissat. At the same time, she added, many Greenlanders remain uneasy about militarization. “Most people here don’t want the military in Greenland,” she said. “But right now, it feels better than nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump is not the first American leader to be drawn to Greenland’s strategic location and vast natural resources. The United States explored acquiring the island in 1867 and again in 1946. But Denmark has long resisted relinquishing control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greenland’s long history with Denmark, “we have many wounds and a lot of pain between us,” said Maria Meier Brun, a social worker whose father was Greenlandic and who joined the protests in Copenhagen. But, she said, there was also a sense of unity between the two peoples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are not American, and we will never be American,” she said. “Some time ago, we wanted to be partners. But right now, I don’t really want to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nuuk, demonstrators gathered near a darkened U.S. consulate, sealed off by police barricades, playing traditional drums and chanting, “Kalaallit Nunaat,” the name for the island in Greenlandic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The president has nothing to do here,” said Parnuna Olsen, 25, a high school student in Nuuk. Others shouted in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he were to come to Greenland, she said, he would not be welcomed, adding that her response would not be polite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18int-venezuela-economy-jvhk/18int-venezuela-economy-jvhk-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nair Granado rushed to buy groceries as soon as she got her $60 paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knew it wouldn’t be enough to fill the pantry in her home on the eastern fringes of Caracas, Venezuela’s capital. Still, she worried that, before long, her earnings would not be enough to cover even the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prices are rising every day,” said Ms. Granado, 33, a lab receptionist living in a sprawling working-class neighborhood with her two children. “It’s completely out of control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After more than a decade in crisis, Venezuela is no stranger to food shortages, high prices and economic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. military raid that removed Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, has plunged the South American nation into a chaotic new chapter of political and economic uncertainty, setting off a new wave of inflation and currency woes pushing basic grocery items out of the reach of many Venezuelans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Granado, on a recent weekday, could still afford to buy flour and half a carton of eggs. But she did not even dream of buying meat — at more than $9 per pound, the price had nearly doubled in only a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You really have to find ways to be frugal, to make your salary stretch,” Ms. Granado said. “It’s getting harder to buy things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic turmoil is now threatening to deepen a yearslong humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, where more than 70 percent of people already live in poverty, according to a survey by a group of leading universities in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new affordability crisis is hitting Venezuelans especially hard because many have already been living on the edge of hunger for years, said Phil Gunson, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, a research organization, who has lived in Venezuela for over two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’ve sold everything they could, they’ve tightened their belts until there are no more holes left,” Mr. Gunson said. “So there’s nothing left to fall back on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of the sharp rise in food costs is Venezuela’s dependence on the U.S. dollar, widely used in everyday transactions because it is typically less volatile than the country’s own currency, the bolívar. When Venezuela’s economy, once Latin America’s richest, spiraled deeper into crisis in 2019, driven by government mismanagement and exacerbated by U.S. sanctions, many people began to save, spend and charge in U.S. dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, even though the country’s economy is not formally “dollarized,” Venezuelans today rely on U.S. dollars for their daily spending. Vendors often buy from suppliers in dollars, so they peg prices to the currency. And they typically charge higher prices if buyers want to pay in Venezuelan bolívars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New U.S. sanctions over the past year have also forced Venezuela to sell less oil on the global market, which has reduced the volume of dollars circulating in its economy and made the currency more valuable. Now, anxiety about Venezuela’s economic future has sent the value of the dollar soaring, effectively doubling local prices of staples like meat, cheese and milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central Bank of Venezuela sets an official exchange rate, but most people rely on an unofficial rate called the “parallel dollar,” which reflects what dollars actually sell for on the street. This past week, the unofficial value of the dollar peaked at twice the official rate. It has since stabilized, but remains well above the official rate — and grocery store prices have not fallen in step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the incomes of Venezuelans, who are mostly paid in bolívars, “have gone up in smoke” as the value of the bolívar has dropped, said José Guerra, an economist and professor at the Central University of Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So we have a case of an economy that is experiencing extremely high inflation and, at the same time, may be entering an economic recession,” he added, estimating inflation could reach 2,000 percent this year. (The Venezuelan government does not publish official economic statistics and has persecuted economists tracking inflation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela’s minimum monthly wage, eroded by a decade of inflation and not adjusted in years, is now equivalent to roughly 50 cents. The government has tried to plug the gap, in part, by paying public-sector workers bonuses, though these have also diminished in value as the currency continues to wither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are signs the United States is already brokering deals for the sale of Venezuelan oil, which could help stave off an economic disaster in the country and inject critical dollars into its economy. But, in the short term, this potential economic lifeline is a long way from helping ordinary Venezuelans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey by Gallup showed that last year, three in five Venezuelans struggled at times to afford food, among the highest rates in Latin America and the Caribbean. Even among the wealthiest 20 percent of Venezuela’s population, more than half said they were finding it difficult to pay for groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, soup kitchens and other community projects that once fed those in need have also been forced to close, as Mr. Maduro targeted nongovernmental groups with restrictive new rules. The government does deliver basic food baskets to the poor, but this welfare program is plagued by frequent and lengthy delays that can leave families without provisions for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Venezuela’s interim government is focused on its new client-like relationship with the Trump administration, many Venezuelans are simply trying to figure out ways to stretch their dwindling purchasing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johana Paredes, 30, said she was used to rationing the month’s groceries for her family of four. But the new sharp increase in food prices has made it difficult to buy even essential items that were, until recently, within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This past week, we couldn’t do any grocery shopping,” Ms. Paredes said, showing the scant supplies in her tin-roofed home in Los Teques, an hour outside Caracas. “That’s why there aren’t even potatoes,” she added. “Before, we were rich and we didn’t even know it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Caracas, shoppers toured the stalls of the city’s most iconic municipal market hunting for a bargain, as vendors shouted prices in dollars and inflated them in bolívars. Leaning on the counter of the butcher shop where he works, Jesús Balza, 50, said customers were buying less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are only spending on necessities,” he said. “Whoever used to buy a kilo of cheese is now buying half.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was on full display in Valencia, a city in central Venezuela, as shoppers walked out of supermarkets with half-empty bags. Marilsa Mendoza spent her budget of 13,000 bolívars, the equivalent of $35, on only a few necessities: flour, rice, pasta, oil and butter. Until a few weeks ago, she was able to buy far more for the same amount. “Everything is terrible, more or less double the price,” said Ms. Mendoza, 52, a hot dog vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has outlined grand plans to revive Venezuela’s oil industry, vowing to strike a series of deals that would bring American investment into the sector. The main engine of the economy has decayed after years of mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while there are early signs that these plans may be taking shape, it is not yet clear whether this financial lifeline will ultimately materialize and fix Venezuela’s broken economy over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Venezuelans long ago lost faith in their government’s ability to improve their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will whatever oil deals are in the works “actually benefit Venezuela,” asked Mr. Gunson, the analyst. “Only time will tell,” he added. “Right now, all we have is Trump saying that he’s taking the oil and he’s going to sell it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As leaders in Caracas and Washington wrestle over Venezuela’s future, Ms. Paredes said she was holding out hope that real transformation would soon begin to reach people like her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We try to stay positive, believing that things will really change,” she said. “Because honestly, we don’t see any improvement. Everything just keeps getting worse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/world/18int-baghdad-embassy-top/18int-baghdad-embassy-top-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 60 years ago, the French government rented a stately mansion in Baghdad from a Jewish Iraqi family and set up its embassy there. France still uses the building as its embassy, but it has not paid rent to the family in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the family is suing France for $22 million, arguing that the country profited from an Iraqi government campaign of antisemitism. The family says France unilaterally abandoned its contract with it, benefiting from a much cheaper deal offered by the Iraqi government, which expropriated the house under a law that dispossessed Jewish owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezra and Khedouri Lawee — brothers who built the home starting in 1935 on the banks of the Tigris River — believed France, a powerful tenant, would honor its commitments to the family when it occupied the house in 1965, despite any potential threats from the Iraqi authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To save the house, my father leased it to the French,” said Mayer Lawee, 86, the son of Ezra Lawee and one of the last surviving family members who lived in the house. “My father was upset. It’s his home. He built it from scratch and it was taken away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a hearing set for Monday in Paris, the family’s lawyers plan to put French principles on trial, presenting the case through the lens of the country’s avowed commitments to righting its past wrongs. The French government, however, views the matter narrowly, and has argued for dismissal, saying that any culpability lies with Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, involving an unusual blend of contractual and human rights claims, also highlights the plight of about 130,000 Iraqi Jews who from 1941 to 1951 fled or were forced from Iraq, where their ancestors had lived since the biblical “Babylonian Captivity” 2,600 years earlier. The Lawees were among 900,000 Jews who fled or were expelled from Arab and Muslim countries after the founding of Israel in 1948&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family’s lawyers contend the case is analogous to claims made by the descendants of Holocaust victims, who are entitled to restitution from the French government for property stolen during the Nazi era. “The French state’s decision to submit to the antisemitic regulations of a foreign state is unconstitutional, illegal and violates international conventions,” Jean-Pierre Mignard and Imrane Ghermi, lawyers for the family, argued in a complaint filed in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France counters that the damages claimed by the family “are directly caused by decisions adopted by the Iraqi authorities.” But in disavowing all responsibility, President Emmanuel Macron’s government finds itself in the awkward position of relying on discriminatory Iraqi laws in its defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lawee brothers designed the large house with classic columns, curved porticos and expansive rooms, each with his wife and children taking a side, and everyone gathering on the roof or in the garden, Mayer Lawee recalled. But in the late 1940s, amid mounting animosity against Jews over the establishment of Israel, he said, Iraq’s king urged the family to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the family soon settled in Canada, where the brothers built similar homes on neighboring Montreal lots with features deliberately reminiscent of their Baghdad mansion. Still, two relatives remained in the Iraqi house for a decade, then entrusted it to a caretaker until the family’s agent made a deal with France in 1964.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise terms of that agreement, just what happened afterward and which laws apply are in dispute. But it is clear that for six turbulent decades, through the rise and fall of Saddam Hussein and two U.S.-led invasions, France has continued using the house as its official outpost in Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1969, when Iraq claimed ownership of the mansion, France has paid rent to the Iraqi government. The family contends that France at first also kept paying it according to the original deal, but stopped in 1974, and ignored its inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France has argued that Iraqi laws depriving Jews of property, beginning in the 1950s, justified French compliance with the Iraqi authorities. It has also demanded more proof of the family’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Younger members of the family grew up with elders speaking Arabic and waxing nostalgic about homes that they would never see again, that subsequent generations could never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I consider myself Iraqi, and then a Canadian, which is funny since I’ve never been to Iraq,” said Philip Khazzam, 66, a grandson of Ezra Lawee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baghdad house loomed large in family lore, and as his elders aged, Mr. Khazzam grew more interested in what happened. The more he dug, he said, the more he became convinced that France had acted unjustly by profiting from Iraq’s discrimination with no objection or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve only seen pictures of our house. But still, it lives in me every day,” Mr. Khazzam said. “Which is why it matters to me — all the decades later and halfway around the world — much more than an ordinary building ever could. It still is a part of our family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Macron has portrayed France as a leader in restitution efforts as debates about restoring property unjustly acquired through war, totalitarianism or colonialism have swept Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, though, the French have been slow to return looted goods, drawing sharp criticism and recently prompting legal changes to speed the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lawees hope that shifting sentiment and laws will influence the court to take an expansive view of their claim, framing it in this wider context. Still, experts in cultural property law said the family does not have a traditional restitution claim, like Nazi-era looting cases. France tightly circumscribes what qualifies for restitution. The family’s claim, based on one country’s submission to another’s discriminatory policies, seems to fall squarely outside that category, they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evelien Campfens, an art and cultural heritage law lecturer at the University of Amsterdam, said that French restitution measures technically would not apply to the Lawee home because it is outside France. But because the property has an intangible value and precious memories for the family, she said, it may be possible for their lawyers to draw an analogy to the looted property in traditional restitution cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort may be more politically powerful than legally sound, according to Anne-Sophie Nardon, a French cultural property lawyer. “I think the goal is to first make the case public and force the government to speak and enter into negotiations,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But failed talks are what led to court. French officials in 2021 responded to the family’s inquiries after attempts over decades yielded no responses. The family hoped France would exert influence in Iraq to help it reclaim the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, France suggested the family try to re-establish Iraqi citizenship to potentially regain ownership rights, rather than attempt an untested diplomatic process. The family says no Iraqi lawyer would handle its case, and in 2024, it took its claim to a French administrative court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Mr. Khazzam wrote to Mr. Macron, urging France to resolve the matter in mediation. “France does not want to occupy stolen property,” he said. “This is for the dictators and thieves who run failing states.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Macron has not answered. His office did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French president has been outspoken about France’s role in the Holocaust and has pledged to vigilantly fight antisemitism. “In the face of hatred, the republic will always have the last word,” he said in September, responding to a rise in attacks against Jews. “The nation will always be mobilized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet in resisting the Lawees’ call for accountability, the government risks calling that commitment into question, and damaging its reputation, said Ms. Campfens of the University of Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a moral claim,” she said, “and it is embarrassing for the French government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/02/multimedia/00int-nigeria-screwdriver-1-vkfp/00int-nigeria-screwdriver-1-vkfp-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a market in southeastern Nigeria, a short man wearing one earbud recently made his way to the tool section, dodging wheelbarrows of sugar cane and porters carrying stacks of hard hats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man, Emeka Umeagbalasi, owns a tiny shop selling screwdrivers and wrenches in this market in Onitsha, the commercial hub of southeast Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this screwdriver salesman is also an unlikely source of research that U.S. Republican lawmakers have used to promote the misleading idea that Christians are being singled out for slaughter in Africa’s most populous nation. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Representative Riley Moore of Virginia and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey have all cited his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with his ideas, President Trump launched airstrikes on the other side of Mr. Umeagbalasi’s country on Christmas Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Mr. Umeagbalasi, that the American president had taken up a cause he had promoted, was “miraculous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If nothing is done,” he said in an interview from his home, “Nigeria will explode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Umeagbalasi says he has documented 125,000 Christian deaths in Nigeria since 2009, but told The New York Times that he often does not verify his data. He acknowledged that his research was mainly based on “secondary sources,” including Christian interest groups, Nigerian news reports and Google searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cruz, Mr. Moore and Mr. Smith did not respond to requests for comment. A White House spokeswoman did not address questions about Mr. Umeagbalasi’s data and methods, but said in a statement that “the massacre of Christians by radical, terrorist scum will not be tolerated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is notoriously difficult to collect data on the killings, kidnappings and attacks that have wrought havoc on Nigerians for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nigerian government does not release comprehensive data on the number of people killed in violent attacks, or their religions. Many attacks in Nigeria go unrecorded because they happen in remote areas and are only heard of long afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some research shows that Christians are being killed in large numbers in Nigeria, researchers say a lack of security and widespread impunity in the most affected parts of the country endangers both Christian and Muslim Nigerians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Umeagbalasi, who is Catholic, founded the International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law, or Intersociety, in 2008. He runs the organization out of his home. His wife, Blessing, an evangelical Christian, is a board member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he has degrees in security studies and peace and conflict resolution from the National Open University of Nigeria and described himself as a very “powerful” and “knowledgeable” investigator, comparing himself with the veteran CNN journalist Christiane Amanpour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when questioned about the accuracy of his data, establishing the religion of victims and determining the intent of perpetrators, he admitted that he rarely travels to the regions where attacks have occurred and usually assumes the victim’s religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Umeagbalasi has said that more than 7,000 Christians were killed in Nigeria in the first seven months of 2025. But an independent conflict-monitoring group, Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, estimates that around 6,700 people, including Islamist insurgents and military personnel, were killed in the same period. Only 3,000 of them were recorded as civilians, but that data is not disaggregated for religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Umeagbalasi explained that he determines the religious identity of victims based on where each attack occurs. If a mass abduction or killing happens in an area where he thinks many Christians live, he assumes the victims are Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For instance, if killings take place in Borno today, when I look at it, I will just look at the zone where the killings take place,” he said, referring to the majority-Muslim state at the heart of Boko Haram’s deadly insurgency in Nigeria. “Once they take place in southern Borno, there is likelihood of the victims being Christians or many of them or most of them being Christians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Boko Haram’s victims are Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also gave the example of 25 schoolgirls recently kidnapped in the state of Kebbi. The girls were all Muslim, according to the school principal and local officials. But Mr. Umeagbalasi claimed that they were mostly Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The girls — a majority of them are Christians, but you know what Nigerian government did?” he said. “They went and Islamized them. Gave them Islamic names just to confuse people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkasim Abdulkadir, a spokesman for Nigeria’s foreign minister, denied that the government had misrepresented the girls’ religion. “There’s a lot of fallacy to his research, a lot of confirmation bias,” he said of Mr. Umeagbalasi. “He’s very performative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Umeagbalasi said he almost never travels to Nigeria’s Middle Belt, the region where violence against Christians is most intense. Instead, he said, he relies on “secondary sources” like news reports and Open Doors, a Christian advocacy group whose data has been cited by Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of his main secondary sources is Truth Nigeria, a project founded by a filmmaker and evangelist from Iowa, Judd Saul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Intersociety and other Christian advocacy groups in Nigeria and the United States, Truth Nigeria frequently identifies the perpetrators of attacks on Christians in the country as “Fulani ethnic militias.” The Fulani are an ethnic group with tens of millions of mostly Muslim members, some of whom are herders whose ancestors have roamed across West Africa for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Umeagbalasi called the Fulani “animals” and said all Fulanis should be confined to one Nigerian state, a move that would be tantamount to ethnic cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers, journalists and prominent Christians regularly dispute Mr. Umeagbalasi’s figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nnamdi Obasi, the Nigeria adviser for the International Crisis Group, described Intersociety’s methodology as “a total blank” and said that the figures in Intersociety’s reports did not add up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The basic addition is very, very faulty,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, the Catholic bishop of Sokoto, the northwestern Nigerian state that the United States bombed in December, said in an interview that focusing too much on the data about Christians obscured a more important issue. “Focus on the fact that this state is weak and doesn’t have the capacity to protect its people,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Umeagbalasi remains undeterred by criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He flipped open his laptop, where he had almost completed work on his next report, titled, “The Situation of Christians in Nigeria Fueled by Jihadist Terrorism Inches a Point of No Return.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is our heavenly marathon,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sat in his living room, its walls painted green and black. A bookshelf was crammed with old papers and plaques. One read, “For excellent service to humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said close to 20,000 churches were destroyed in the past 16 years, and, he said, 100,000 churches existed in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no government data on the number of churches in Nigeria. So where did he get the 100,000 figure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Googled it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting was contributed by Saikou Jammeh, Dionne Searcey, Ismail Auwal and David Chidi Eleke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18int-europe-tariffs-assess-01-gblw/18int-europe-tariffs-assess-01-gblw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a single post on Saturday night, President Trump upended months of progress on trade negotiations with an ultimatum that puts Europe on a crash course with the United States — long its closest ally and suddenly one of its biggest threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Truth Social post, Mr. Trump demanded a deal to buy Greenland, saying that otherwise he would slap tariffs on a group of European nations, first 10 percent in February, then 25 percent in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appeared to leave little room for Europe to maneuver or negotiate in a harsh and combative era of geopolitics. It also left Europe with few options to counter Mr. Trump without repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders are loath to accept the forced takeover of an autonomous territory that is controlled by Denmark, a member of both NATO and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials and outside analysts increasingly argue that Europe will need to respond to Mr. Trump with force, most likely by hitting back on trade. But doing so could come at a heavy cost both to the bloc’s economy and to its security, since Europe remains heavily reliant on the United States for support through NATO and in Russia’s war with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We either fight a trade war, or we’re in a real war,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europeans have spent more than a year insisting that Greenland is not for sale and have constantly repeated that the fate of the massive northern island must be decided by its people and by Denmark. Last week, a group of European nations sent personnel to Greenland for military exercises — a show of solidarity that may have triggered Mr. Trump, since the same nations are the ones to be slapped with tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercises were intended to reinforce Europe’s commitment to policing the Arctic. Mr. Trump has insisted that the United States needs to own Greenland to improve security in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, the exercises were part of an ongoing effort to placate Mr. Trump. For weeks, officials across Europe had dismissed Mr. Trump’s threats to take Greenland, even by military force, as unlikely. Many saw them more as negotiating tactics and hoped that they could satisfy the American president with a willingness to beef up defense and spending on Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Trump’s fixation on owning the island and his escalating rhetoric is crushing European hopes that appeasement and dialogue will work. Facing the reality that a negotiated compromise is less and less likely, Europeans are now racing to figure out how to respond to Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within hours of the post, members of the European Parliament announced that they will freeze the ratification of the trade deal that Mr. Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, struck last summer. And members of European Parliament are openly calling for trade retaliation. Ambassadors from across the 27-nation bloc will gather in Brussels for an emergency meeting at 5 p.m. on Sunday, diplomats said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitting back is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe has a trade weapon specifically created to defend against political coercion quickly and forcefully, and as Mr. Trump’s threats sank in, policymakers argued that this is the time to wield it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool — officially called the “anti-coercion instrument,” unofficially called Europe’s trade “bazooka” — could be used to slap limitations on big American technology companies or other service providers that do large amounts of business on the continent. But using it would sharply ratchet up trans-Atlantic tensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe has spent the past year avoiding such escalation, and for a reason. The continent remains deeply reliant on the United States for NATO protection and for support against Russia in the war on Ukraine, so a full-on trade war could have consequences on other fronts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question is — how far do you want to go?” said Penny Naas, an expert on European public policy at the German Marshall Fund think tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders are still hoping that they might be able to talk things out. Ms. von der Leyen struck an accommodating tone in a social media post on Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the U.S.,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she also warned that tariffs would “risk a dangerous downward spiral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, talks have been all but futile. Foreign policy officials from Denmark and Greenland met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance in Washington last week. Afterward, the Danes and Greenlanders acknowledged that the two sides remained at an impasse, but expressed hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides, they noted, had agreed to set up a high-level working group to work through their issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That optimism was quickly snuffed out when the White House said that the group was meant to work on America’s “acquisition” of Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is just all brute force,” Ms. Naas said. “The president really wants Greenland, and he’s not backing off of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland shows little sign of wanting to be acquired, by money or by military force. Greenlanders have at times chafed at Danish power, but polls and interviews indicate that most don’t want to give up their free education and universal health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Trump takes on a more aggressive posture, European leaders are growing blunter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, wrote on social media on Saturday night that “no intimidation nor threat will influence us.” Ulf Kristersson, the prime minister of Sweden, wrote that “we will not let ourselves be blackmailed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Keir Starmer, the prime minister of Britain — which, like Norway, is not in the European Union, but was listed among the countries that will be slapped with tariffs — called Mr. Trump’s tariff move “completely wrong.” Mr. Starmer has carefully cultivated a positive relationship with the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will of course be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration,” he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/30/multimedia/00int-uk-sweep-01-bvjh/00int-uk-sweep-01-bvjh-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against a gray London skyline, a spiky round brush protruded from the chimney of a large family house as Josh Firkins got to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brush would have been familiar, Mr. Firkins said, to his great-great-great-grandfather Charles, who began working as a chimney sweep in the mid-19th century. Other aspects of the job would have seemed outlandish to him, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A digital camera revealed the chimney’s interior. An industrial vacuum cleaner removed soot and other debris dislodged by the brush. Earlier, a drone buzzed above the house, scanning the state of the rooftop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chimney sweeps were once an essential part of British life, when households relied on coal and wood-burning fires to heat their homes. They have played an outsize role in the cultural imagination, whether because of Dick Van Dyke’s portrayal of Bert in “Mary Poppins” or — less cheerfully — the children sent up flues in the 18th and 19th centuries, some getting stuck or suffocating in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass adoption of central heating in the second half of the 20th century, and the introduction of clean air regulations, meant open fires fell out of fashion and the industry shrank. But some firms survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, many sweeps, including those in the Firkins family business, say the trade has been experiencing an improbable resurgence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the National Association of Chimney Sweeps, demand has been bolstered by high energy prices, the popularity of wood-burning stoves and an international climate that has prompted warnings that electricity supplies could be vulnerable to attack by hostile states like Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are thinking, ‘Let’s have a backup, let’s have a fire, let’s have a stove in case the electricity goes off,’” said Martin Glynn, the president of the chimney sweeps association, whose membership has risen to about 750 today, from about 590 in 2021. “If you have the ability to burn logs or smokeless fuel, you can keep cooking and have some heating. There is a big increase in demand and people are reopening their fireplaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a recent day, he said, three people had booked training courses. The association’s membership now includes 40 female sweeps. “It’s alive and kicking,” he said of the group, adding: “We don’t send little boys up chimneys any more, instead it’s CCTV and smoke testing equipment. It’s almost like being a chimney technician.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revival of open fires and stoves in homes, even on a small scale, does not come without costs. Scientists and campaigners warn that both produce a fine particulate matter, PM2.5, a harmful pollutant that is associated with respiratory problems, heart disease and even dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, England banned the sale of almost all traditional coal for domestic use. But even urban areas like London allow the burning of officially authorized smokeless fuels, which produce very little visible smoke, but do generate soot, although much less than coal does. To limit air pollution, the British government recommends that chimneys be professionally swept once a year, and that households choose the cleanest available fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chimney sweeps have been in business in Britain since at least 1519, the date of the first recorded payment to one, according to a history of the trade, “British Chimney Sweeps” by Benita Cullingford. Records are sparse because sweeps had no guild to keep documents, unlike in some other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 18th and 19th centuries, “climbing boys,” often orphans, were enlisted to clamber up narrow chimneys. This dangerous, sometimes deadly activity was outlawed by an act of Parliament in 1875, not long after the death of George Brewster, 11, who got stuck in a chimney in Fulbourn, near Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Census records show that Charles Firkins, Mr. Firkins’s ancestor, was sweeping chimneys in 1860. By 1864, his three brothers had joined him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family had its share of drama, including one altercation, recorded in the local press, in which Charles punched a rival who mocked the way he advertised his services with the cry, “Sweep, sweep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Firkins, 37, has heard of builders recovering the remains of children in chimneys. More common is the discovery of hidden items. Mr. Firkins uncovered a stash of love letters written by men to a male doctor dating from an era before homosexuality was legalized. Mr. Firkins’s father once recovered a revolver, which was turned in to the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a century and a half after the family business began, chimney sweeping remains profitable for H Firkins &amp; Sons. In the winter months, Mr. Firkins said, “we’ll probably take 70 to 80 calls a day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People enjoy sitting in front of a fire,” he said. “You can shut the curtains, light a fire and it doesn’t really matter what’s going on outside. People have a glass of wine, the fire’s alight, they read a book. I guess they switch off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believes the rising cost of living is driving the surge in business. Although fires are less efficient than gas or electric systems, they can help ration the use of central heating, while those with access to free or cheap wood can save cash in areas where burning logs is permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our busiest times are when there is a recession or when energy prices are high,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the house in north London, where Mr. Firkins was recently working, Michael Netter, 41, an expert in building conservation and sustainability, watched as his fireplaces were checked during a renovation before he and his family move in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Netter, who has lived in London for 14 years, was raised in Toledo, Ohio, in a house with an open fireplace. Still, it was unusual to have his chimney swept by a family firm dating back to 1860. “We certainly wouldn’t have that in the Midwest,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Britain, the profession seems safe for another generation, judging from the enthusiasm of Tom Joslin, 19, who joined Mr. Firkins as an apprentice 14 months ago, after leaving college and trying catering and bar work. His youthful appearance causes clients to jokingly ask if he will be climbing into the chimney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are one or two downsides, Mr. Joslin said, including dealing with creatures that lurk in chimneys — large spiders, birds that get stuck and the occasional angry hornet. But those are only minor inconveniences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I absolutely love it,” he said. “It’s the best job I think I could ever get.”&lt;/p&gt;
