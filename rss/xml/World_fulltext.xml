&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16int-iran-protests-lbpq/16int-iran-protests-lbpq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A heavy police presence and deadly crackdowns on protesters appeared to have largely suppressed demonstrations in many cities and towns across Iran, according to several witnesses and a human rights group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For weeks, Iran has been convulsed by protests sparked by a collapsing economy and a currency in free fall, with the demonstrations snowballing into a broader antigovernment movement. The authorities have sought to quell the protests with brutal force and have plunged the country into a communications blackout that has made it difficult to know what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four residents reached by The New York Times in the capital, Tehran, said that the streets had mostly been quiet of protests this week as the severity of the crackdown and the high number of casualties became clear. Security forces were deployed in large numbers to nearly every neighborhood, said the residents, who lived in different parts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. They said that it felt as if the capital was under martial law, with the typically bustling and traffic-clogged streets largely empty. Shops and restaurants in some areas were closed after 6 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is massive disappointment and disillusionment,” said another resident, who worked in central Tehran and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been no large-scale protests documented in Iran since Sunday, according to Arina Moradi and Mina Khani, members of the Norway-based Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, which has been monitoring the demonstrations since they began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Moradi said in an interview that a heavy military and security presence remained across many cities and towns, with thousands of people having been detained. She said numerous universities had closed following protests last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Israeli defense assessment found that the scale of protests had noticeably declined since Sunday, following the Iranian forces’ escalating use of live ammunition and the internet blackout, according to two Israeli officials who spoke to the Times on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the numbers continued to drop, they said, several Israeli intelligence officials monitoring Iran had concluded that the current wave of protests had effectively been subdued by the regime. The two officials noted, however, that the Israeli assessment had been complicated by the disruption of internet and telephone services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions across Iran and the region have been high after Mr. Trump recently declared he was prepared to intervene to protect protesters, including potential military strikes against the country, U.S. officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel and several Arab nations have urged President Trump not to strike Iran, a senior U.S. official said. Many Gulf States worry that an attack could destabilize the region and jeopardize their reputations as safe hubs for business and tourism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin said on Friday that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia offered to mediate so as to ensure regional stability after speaking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The situation in the region is extremely tense,” a Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters on Friday, adding that Mr. Putin was trying to facilitate a de-escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent days, the Iranian authorities have stepped back from threats to execute protesters, following international condemnation and the looming possibility of U.S. military action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But regional analysts note that Tehran is drawing a line between ordinary demonstrators and those it labels “rioters” or “terrorists” purportedly backed by foreign powers. Experts say this careful framing is intended to intimidate the population and discourage further protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has been instilling fear into protesters by sending text messages warning families not to let their children go out into the streets. Other messages have urged people to report suspicious activities or encouraged them to attend pro-government rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a screenshot shared by a resident with The New York Times, a text message asserting to be from the intelligence branch of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said it had received more than 400,000 calls to a hotline for reporting “terrorist networks,” and that they had been “identified and dismantled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s violent crackdown has had an especially chilling effect on the protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnesses said security forces had fired on unarmed demonstrators at close range. More than 2,600 people have been killed since protests began, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights group said that more than 3,400 people had been killed and thousands of others injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Mr. Trump said the United States was “locked and loaded” to protect Iranian protesters, whom he later urged to take over government institutions, saying U.S. support was imminent. Since then, Mr. Trump has announced that diplomatic talks with Iran were on, then off, and most recently said Iran had responded to his demands by halting the killing and execution of protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday that President Trump and his team were “closely monitoring the situation” and that “all options remain on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronen Bergman and Paul Sonne contributed reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18int-europe-tariffs-assess-01-gblw/18int-europe-tariffs-assess-01-gblw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a single post on Saturday night, President Trump upended months of progress on trade negotiations with an ultimatum that puts Europe on a crash course with the United States — long its closest ally and suddenly one of its biggest threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Truth Social post, Mr. Trump demanded a deal to buy Greenland, saying that otherwise he would slap tariffs on a group of European nations, first 10 percent in February, then 25 percent in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appeared to leave little room for Europe to maneuver or negotiate in a harsh and combative era of geopolitics. It also left Europe with few options to counter Mr. Trump without repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders are loath to accept the forced takeover of an autonomous territory that is controlled by Denmark, a member of both NATO and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials and outside analysts increasingly argue that Europe will need to respond to Mr. Trump with force, most likely by hitting back on trade. But doing so could come at a heavy cost both to the bloc’s economy and to its security, since Europe remains heavily reliant on the United States for support through NATO and in Russia’s war with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We either fight a trade war, or we’re in a real war,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europeans have spent more than a year insisting that Greenland is not for sale and have constantly repeated that the fate of the massive northern island must be decided by its people and by Denmark. Last week, a group of European nations sent personnel to Greenland for military exercises — a show of solidarity that may have triggered Mr. Trump, since the same nations are the ones to be slapped with tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercises were intended to reinforce Europe’s commitment to policing the Arctic. Mr. Trump has insisted that the United States needs to own Greenland to improve security in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, the exercises were part of an ongoing effort to placate Mr. Trump. For weeks, officials across Europe had dismissed Mr. Trump’s threats to take Greenland, even by military force, as unlikely. Many saw them more as negotiating tactics and hoped that they could satisfy the American president with a willingness to beef up defense and spending on Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Trump’s fixation on owning the island and his escalating rhetoric is crushing European hopes that appeasement and dialogue will work. Facing the reality that a negotiated compromise is less and less likely, Europeans are now racing to figure out how to respond to Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within hours of the post, members of the European Parliament announced that they will freeze the ratification of the trade deal that Mr. Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, struck last summer. And members of European Parliament are openly calling for trade retaliation. Ambassadors from across the 27-nation bloc will gather in Brussels for an emergency meeting at 5 p.m. on Sunday, diplomats said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitting back is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe has a trade weapon specifically created to defend against political coercion quickly and forcefully, and as Mr. Trump’s threats sank in, policymakers argued that this is the time to wield it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool — officially called the “anti-coercion instrument,” unofficially called Europe’s trade “bazooka” — could be used to slap limitations on big American technology companies or other service providers that do large amounts of business on the continent. But using it would sharply ratchet up trans-Atlantic tensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe has spent the past year avoiding such escalation, and for a reason. The continent remains deeply reliant on the United States for NATO protection and for support against Russia in the war on Ukraine, so a full-on trade war could have consequences on other fronts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question is — how far do you want to go?” said Penny Naas, an expert on European public policy at the German Marshall Fund think tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders are still hoping that they might be able to talk things out. Ms. von der Leyen struck an accommodating tone in a social media post on Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the U.S.,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she also warned that tariffs would “risk a dangerous downward spiral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, talks have been all but futile. Foreign policy officials from Denmark and Greenland met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance in Washington last week. Afterward, the Danes and Greenlanders acknowledged that the two sides remained at an impasse, but expressed hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides, they noted, had agreed to set up a high-level working group to work through their issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That optimism was quickly snuffed out when the White House said that the group was meant to work on America’s “acquisition” of Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is just all brute force,” Ms. Naas said. “The president really wants Greenland, and he’s not backing off of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland shows little sign of wanting to be acquired, by money or by military force. Greenlanders have at times chafed at Danish power, but polls and interviews indicate that most don’t want to give up their free education and universal health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Trump takes on a more aggressive posture, European leaders are growing blunter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, wrote on social media on Saturday night that “no intimidation nor threat will influence us.” Ulf Kristersson, the prime minister of Sweden, wrote that “we will not let ourselves be blackmailed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Keir Starmer, the prime minister of Britain — which, like Norway, is not in the European Union, but was listed among the countries that will be slapped with tariffs — called Mr. Trump’s tariff move “completely wrong.” Mr. Starmer has carefully cultivated a positive relationship with the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will of course be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration,” he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Syrian government and a Kurdish-led militia agreed on Sunday to an immediate cease-fire, after weeks of on-and-off clashes, and to a full integration of the militia into the national military forces, according to state media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not the first time that the government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., have reached such a deal. But the 14-point agreement came after two days of significant territorial advances by government forces into areas long held by the S.D.F., which left the force in a significantly weaker negotiating position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, the S.D.F. agreed to hand over the northern province of Raqqa and the eastern province of Deir al Zour. That will leave only one province, northeastern Hasakah, in S.D.F. hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government institutions in a largely autonomous northeastern region dominated by Kurds will also come under the central government’s authority, according to the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will also take control of all the country’s gas and oil fields, nearly all of which have been under S.D.F. control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18int-denmark-mood-02-ptvk-copy/18int-denmark-mood-02-ptvk-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henrik Bager, a Danish soldier who served with Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan, said President Trump’s vow to get Greenland from Denmark and his insults about Denmark’s military were “a punch to the gut.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmus Jarlov, a voluble center-right member of the Danish Parliament and the chairman of its Defense Committee, said that “we know full well that the Americans can destroy us,” but should Mr. Trump, who has not ruled out military force, attack a fellow NATO ally, “of course we will fight back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next breath, Mr. Jarlov said it was “absolutely so weird to be uttering something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casper O. Jensen, a Danish pollster who has lived in the United States and calls it “close to his heart,” sounded like a jilted lover. “I thought we had a really good thing going on,” he said. “Apparently not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are bleak times in Copenhagen, where Danes say they feel betrayed, bewildered and frightened by Mr. Trump’s threats to take over Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish territory and a source of national identity and pride. Greenland, 50 times the size of Denmark, has long made the tiny Nordic nation more of a player on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not small when you add Greenland,” said David Trads, a political commentator and the author of three books on the United States, including his most recent, “America Turns the Clock Back.” “It makes us more important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump’s view is that the United States needs to take over Greenland because Russia and China pose a security threat in the Arctic, and because the island is essential for the “Golden Dome” missile shield he wants to build to protect the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark, NATO allies and most security experts say Mr. Trump already has all the access to Greenland that he needs given existing treaties and the willingness of Denmark, long one of the most pro-American countries in Europe, to do anything — short of giving up Greenland — that the president wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week in Copenhagen, where wall-to-wall television coverage of the crisis seemed to match the mood of the dark Scandinavian winter, Danes pored over every utterance from Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Saturday, thousands of Danes had packed Copenhagen’s City Hall Square before marching to the U.S. Embassy in protest, while hundreds demonstrated in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital. Hours later, Mr. Trump said he was putting new tariffs on Denmark and other European nations until they come to the negotiating table to sell him Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danes have been particularly stunned by Mr. Trump’s taunts that Denmark relies on “two dog sleds” to defend the Arctic island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like fifth graders bullying the small guy in the corner,” said Company Sgt. Maj. Bager, the Danish soldier who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Danes in his unit died during his 2009 deployment to Helmand Province in Afghanistan, he said, and the rhetoric from the White House hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First time you get disappointed, then you get angry, and then you start feeling sad, you know?” he said. “I can’t remember when we haven’t been with you. You asked us to go. We went.” You asked us “to send airplanes, we sent airplanes.” Denmark, he said, “never said no.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Price, the creator of “Borgen,” a Danish TV political drama that became an international hit, set its fourth and final season in Greenland. In episodes that aired in 2022 in the United States, a geopolitical struggle unfolds between the United States, China and Russia after large reserves of oil are discovered on the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Price likes to take real events and push them beyond what has actually happened. But in an interview this past week, he said that had he pitched a story line to Netflix that an American president was vowing to get Greenland from Denmark “one way or another” — the exact words of Mr. Trump — “I would have been laughed out of the pitching room.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They would have said, ‘It’s too much, it is too crazy,’” Mr. Price said in his Copenhagen office, where a large photograph of sled dogs and icebergs in Greenland covers one wall. “I mean, you wouldn’t have an American president that would actually threaten a NATO ally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Danes believe Mr. Trump wants to own Greenland because, as he put it to The New York Times in an interview this month, “that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaja Chemnitz, one of two members of Parliament who represent Greenland, said in an interview that “maybe you should take it up with his therapist if it’s a question of making sure that he feels better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Chemnitz, who said Greenlanders were having trouble sleeping for fear of an American invasion, was host last week to a bipartisan congressional delegation led by Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, to Denmark. In her view, Mr. Trump is more interested in the minerals and oil in Greenland than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sentiment was echoed by Oliver Haagensen, 21, a medical student at Aarhus University, who was skating the other day at an outdoor rink in Copenhagen’s Christianshavn neighborhood. Like everyone else, he was keeping up with the news on Mr. Trump. “He knows that Russia and China want the minerals and oil, and he wants to get there first,” Mr. Haagensen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some short-lived relief in Copenhagen after a meeting on Wednesday in Washington, where Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, emerged from talks with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Mr. Rasmussen said that although a “fundamental disagreement” remained with Mr. Trump and that the American president “has this wish of conquering Greenland,” there would be a “working group” group to continue talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on Thursday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters that the Danes and Greenlanders had agreed “to continue to have technical talks on the acquisition of Greenland,” which Denmark and Greenland said was not the case at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trads, the political commentator, had been skeptical that the meeting would produce anything. On Wednesday over coffee near the Danish Parliament, he said that the only thing that Denmark had on its side against Mr. Trump was time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Danish government hopes that Mr. Trump’s party will lose the midterm elections, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If that doesn’t happen, then we’re just waiting for the three years to pass,” Mr. Trads said. “It’s a long time, but we don’t have anything else. So that’s the whole tactic, just to make sure it goes on and on and on, and somehow he is preoccupied with something else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark colonized Greenland in 1721, and over the centuries, Greenlanders often felt mistreated by the Danes, particularly by a past policy of forcing contraception on young women and girls. In recent decades, the island has moved to home rule. Denmark, which still sends the island of 56,000 people large economic subsidies, now supports its gradual path to independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been tensions along that road, but Mr. Trump has had the effect, Danes said, of pushing the former colonizer and the colonized closer together. “If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark,” Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen of Greenland said last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is extraordinary about Mr. Trump’s involvement, said Martin Breum, an Arctic expert and TV journalist and the author of “Cold Rush: The Astonishing True Story of the New Quest for the Polar North,” are the president’s repeated falsehoods about Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is extreme consternation that your president appears completely immune to data, facts, arguments and common knowledge,” Mr. Breum said. “He continues to state what is obviously, factually wrong. This seems unbelievable to many people in this country. We cannot understand what is happening. We wonder what is next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carsten Jensen, a prominent Danish novelist and the author of “We, The Drowned,” a work of historical fiction about a century of Danish seafaring, said he knew what was next if Europe did not stand together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m 100 percent convinced that Greenland will become American within a short time,” he said gloomily in an interview. “One day, there will be a lot of American military presence in the airport of Nuuk, and that’s it.” NATO will protest, he said, but he predicted it would not end the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“European nations won’t break up NATO because of Greenland,” he said. “It’s too insignificant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a less dark note, Anne Bech, 60, a schoolteacher who was volunteering last Wednesday at Copenhagen’s central library for a session of the Danish tradition of morgensang — communal morning singing — said the theme of songs for the day, about caring for others, had been selected long before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But today it’s even more important,” she said as retirees, students and people on their way to work filed in and picked up songbooks. “We’re very anxious about your president.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next half-hour, a chorus of voices, accompanied by a piano and flute, filled the library’s top floor. The lyrics at the end of Song No. 150 seemed fitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there’s winter darkness at my door&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m empty and sad like never before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show me a way, just a tiny path&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;out of the darkness I’m caught in.&lt;/p&gt;

A high-speed train smashed into another train after derailing in the southern province of Córdoba, officials said. The cause of the accident was not immediately clear.

&lt;p&gt;At least 16 people have died as ferocious wildfires gripped Southern Chile, burning homes and thousands of hectares of land, the authorities said Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blazes destroyed entire neighborhoods in the southern region of Biobío, according to local authorities, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people to temporary shelters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footage captured expansive flames lashing at buildings, with dense smoke obscuring the horizon under a heavy orange haze. Collapsed buildings and carbonized cars lined the scorched streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am devastated,” said Rodrigo Vera, the mayor of Penco, a city of about 50,000 people, 250 miles South of Santiago, as he described a scene of desperation on Chilean radio on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Vera said that some firefighters were trapped in the fire, and that he had seen others crying on the floor of the command post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 20,000 people had to leave their homes, Mr. Vera said, and emergency crews evacuated patients from a hospital that came under threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor issued an appeal to the national government. “I beg you please from the deepest part of my heart: Come help us,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early hours of Sunday, Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric, declared a “state of catastrophe” for the regions of Ñuble and Biobío. That allowed the government to deploy the army to these areas, where the fires had already affected over 24,000 hectares of land, about 60,000 acres, according to the forestry commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile’s public security minister, Luis Cordero, put the death toll at 16 on Sunday. “There are people who are yet to be located, many of whom may be in shelters,” he said. “The information will be updated progressively as family members report back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile’s national forestry commission said that there are 24 fires actively being fought nationwide, with the majority in the southern forests. The latest surge of fires has been exacerbated by a heat wave in southern Chile, where temperatures were expected to reach 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) today, and winds of up to 55 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile battles wildfires every summer, with most of the fires concentrated over the hottest months, January and February. Last summer, there were 3,018 fires in the country, and this year there have already been 2,825, with the hottest period of the year only beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this summer season, the government announced in November a budget of about $180 million to fight the fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, the deadliest wildfires in Chile’s history ravaged the country’s central coastline, killing 135 people and destroying or damaging 8,188 homes. On that occasion, high winds and prolonged drought contributed to the fires sweeping through the hills and causing widespread devastation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildfires have also gripped the Argentine Patagonia in recent weeks, engulfing nearly 30,000 hectares since mid-December, according to Greenpeace. Though they did not claim any lives, the fires burned through native forests, destroying homes across multiple communities and killing wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18int-tariffs-retaliate-fzkp/18int-tariffs-retaliate-fzkp-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with the threat of punishing tariffs by President Trump if he does not get his way over acquiring Greenland, European Union leaders began to coalesce around a negotiation strategy on Sunday, without ruling out retaliatory taxes of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump on Saturday had demanded a deal to buy Greenland, saying on social media that otherwise he would slap tariffs on a group of European nations, starting with 10 percent in February, then ramping up to 25 percent in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, ambassadors from across the 27-nation bloc met in Brussels to take stock of the situation. While those were just preliminary talks, they made a few things clear. Officials would rather negotiate than retaliate, for one. But they are also committed to protecting Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, from being bought or taken over if that is not what its people want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration showed no signs of backing down. In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that European leaders would eventually understand that American control of Greenland would be “best for Greenland, best for Europe and best for the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The European leaders will come around,” Mr. Bessent said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Washington continues to escalate its efforts, European officials could also consider hitting back, two diplomats familiar with the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials are entertaining the possibility of allowing a list of retaliatory tariffs worth 93 billion euros, or $107 billion — drawn up during last year’s trade war — to take effect in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some members of the European Parliament and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, have suggested that the European Union should activate an even more drastic tool: A never-used weapon intended to combat economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That option — officially called the “anti-coercion instrument,” and unofficially referred to as Europe’s trade “bazooka” — could be used to slap restrictions on big American technology companies or other service providers that conduct large amounts of business on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would not be a first resort, the diplomats said, because it would risk escalating the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the European Union’s options are likely to be up for discussion later this week, when leaders gather in Brussels. António Costa, the president of the European Council, which gives the European Union political direction, announced on Sunday that he had “decided to convene an extraordinary meeting” of European leaders in the coming days. An E.U. official added that the meeting might be in person, and that it could take place on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a session would allow prime ministers and presidents from across the bloc to discuss how they might respond to Mr. Trump. It would also come just as, or before, many European policymakers head to Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Forum. Mr. Trump is also planning to attend, creating a chance for conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many European leaders are still hoping they might be able to talk things out, discussions have essentially been futile so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe has been hesitant to retaliate against the United States, in part because it relies on America for military technologies and support for NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Brando Benifei, a member of the European Parliament and the chair of its delegation for U.S. relations, said that calculus may be shifting, in part because popular opinion in Europe has turned more critical of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are saying that we are clearly over a red line,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain spoke to Mr. Trump on Sunday and told him that “applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is wrong,” a Downing Street spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, told reporters on Sunday that she had also spoken to Mr. Trump and called the proposed tariffs a “mistake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Rutte, the secretary-general of NATO, said on social media that he, too, had spoken with Mr. Trump about Greenland, but provided few details, saying only that “we will continue working on this” and that he looked forward to seeing Mr. Trump at Davos this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House did not immediately comment on the spate of calls, which come a day after Mr. Trump’s announcement of new tariffs was met with unified outrage by U.S. allies. Several of those allies, including Britain, France and Germany, released a forceful joint statement with Denmark on Sunday that decried the tariff threats, saying that they “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-signers of the statement, all NATO countries, said they would continue to stand in solidarity with Greenland and vowed to remain “united and coordinated in our response.” The statement was later endorsed by several other European countries, including Iceland, Latvia and Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19int-uk-harry-explainer-ghjb/19int-uk-harry-explainer-ghjb-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince Harry’s latest legal case in Britain is set to begin on Monday in London’s High Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prince and several other high-profile figures are accusing Associated Newspapers, the publisher of The Daily Mail, of unlawful information gathering, including phone hacking, and of intruding into their private lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is set to last for more than two months, and Harry is scheduled to testify on Thursday. The other claimants include Elton John and his husband, David Furnish, the actresses Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, a former British government minister, and a racial justice campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry and the other claimants accuse the company of carrying out or commissioning unlawful activities to reveal private information about their lives for articles published from 1997 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written arguments presented at a preliminary hearing in May said there had been “clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering by private investigators” hired by Associated Newspapers, with “payments spanning decades” and involvement by newspaper executives and numerous journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private investigators are accused of hacking and tapping phones, placing listening devices in cars and “blagging” — a way of tricking people into handing over information — to obtain phone numbers, personal records and bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper group, which owns The Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday and several other titles that are not implicated in the case, has denied all the accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a preliminary hearing on Thursday, four days before the trial was to start, a lawyer for Associated Newspapers, Anthony White, said he would argue that some of the claimants’ witnesses “are not telling the truth” and that he would raise questions about their credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associated Newspapers said in a statement that its journalists had not commissioned or obtained information derived from illegal activity and called the accusations “preposterous and without foundation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added, “The stories concerned, many of which were published 20 or more years ago, and not subject to any complaint at the time, were the product of responsible journalism based on legitimate sources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a schedule jointly drawn up by both legal teams, the trial will run for more than two months and end on March 26. The judge hearing the case, Matthew Nicklin, is expected to consider the evidence and arguments before giving a ruling at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case will begin with lawyers for the claimants and Associated Newspapers giving an outline of their case. Prince Harry is expected to give evidence in person at the High Court on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elton John, the other claimants and witnesses, including Ms. Frost’s former husband, the actor Jude Law, are also set to be questioned by lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private investigators accused of wrongdoing will appear at the trial, as will the former editor of The Daily Mail, Paul Dacre, and several past and present Associated Newspapers executives and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is one of several pursued by Harry since 2020, when he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped down from their royal roles and left Britain, later making their home in Montecito, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have centered on accusations of press intrusion, which Harry said was a key reason behind their decision to move. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, Harry said that he feared “history repeating itself,” referring to the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a car crash while she was being chased by paparazzi in Paris in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said there was an “invisible contract” between Britain’s royal family and the country’s tabloids, adding, “There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of The Daily Mirror, another tabloid, settled a claim over phone hacking in February 2024. During that case, Harry became the first senior royal to testify in court since 1891.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers agreed to pay a “substantial” amount of damages to Harry to settle a long-running lawsuit relating to articles in The Sun and the long-closed News of the World. News Group apologized for “serious intrusion” into Harry’s personal life between 1996 and 2011 and admitted for the first time to unlawful activities by private investigators working for The Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry lost an unrelated legal battle last May over his publicly funded security in Britain, which was downgraded after his decision to step back from royal duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But late last year, the government body responsible for royal security decisions began a review of his protection arrangements, according to two people familiar with the situation who were not given permission to speak publicly. The review appears to offer a glimmer of good news for the prince, who has spoken of his desire to visit Britain with his family if his automatic right to security is reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19int-vietnam-explainer-1-ktlw/19int-vietnam-explainer-1-ktlw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Communist Party of Vietnam on Monday opened its most consequential party congress in decades, as the nation — an emerging middle power and one of Asia’s most dynamic countries — is facing its best and last chance to “get rich before getting old.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 40 years of reform and an extraordinary rise out of poverty, Vietnam is under mounting pressure to pursue bolder reforms to catch up with regional neighbors like South Korea and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnam, a country of 102 million people, has a shrinking window in which the working-age population will still be large enough to drive rapid growth before society ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, shifting geopolitics offer a mix of pressure and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both China and the United States see Vietnam as strategically important. It has a long coastline along the contested sea routes of the South China Sea, as well as a rapidly growing manufacturing base that draws on Chinese supply chains and ships more of its exports to the United States than anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington and Beijing, along with Moscow and much of Europe, are all pushing Vietnam to lean their way while trying to gauge where the country is heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weeklong party congress in Hanoi ends Jan. 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, Vietnam’s one-party state has been governed by the top four members of the Communist Party’s Politburo — the so-called “Four Pillars” — the general secretary, the president, the prime minister and the chair of the National Assembly. The arrangement was designed to keep power from being concentrated in a single leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the party is now rushing to reach ambitious targets set by the last congress: raising per capita gross domestic product by about 70 percent to $8,500 by 2030 and building enough of an industrial economy to become a high-income developed country by 2045.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is very important for the party to deliver on these goals,” said Nguyen Hong Hai, political scientist at VinUniversity in Hanoi. “The Communist Party’s legitimacy will be reinforced by its performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era of uncertainty fueled by the United States and China, the party chief, To Lam, is likely to amass more power by also taking on the role of president. Cuba and China have similar structures with single leaders who head up the party and the state. According to several officials and diplomats, who declined to be named as they discussed party nominations, Mr. Lam, 68, is the only nominee for both posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current president, Luong Cuong, 68, a military general, is expected to retire. If Mr. Lam’s dual role is approved, it would signal that the military, a powerful faction since the war, has been at least somewhat sidelined — as Mr. Lam consolidates power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, Mr. Lam was mostly known as an enforcer. A former head of public security, he rose to become Vietnam’s top leader in 2024 after the death of his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Mr. Lam’s party leadership has delivered a whirlwind of change, starting with a huge administrative overhaul that consolidated provinces and put tens of thousands of officials out of work. A lover of soccer, jazz and classical music, he has also promoted a building spree for stadiums and opera houses, along with new roads, train lines and airports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, he has sought to elevate loyalists, strengthen ties to large quasi-state-run companies, and win over both the party establishment and prominent figures from southern Vietnam whom his predecessor treated as pariahs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among his methods: He has brought large entourages on trips overseas while speaking frequently about an “era of national rise” for Vietnam, with the private sector playing a bigger role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lam is seen as a potential transitional figure who could create more amenable conditions for a broader range of private enterprise. But critics stress that the party still prioritizes central control. Despite their low productivity, state-owned and state-favored companies still enjoy special treatment. New laws give greater power to authorities to find and crack down on “anti-state” commentary, with some worrying that could include accurate, unflattering information about the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The congress will draw together 1,586 delegates, representing the 5.6 million people who are registered party members. Most delegates are appointed by the party. Their job this week will entail discussing Communist Party promotions after shuttling from upscale Marriott and Lotte hotels to a convention center in Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, they will name around 200 officials to the Central Committee. That group picks the 17 to 19 members of the Politburo, the party’s most powerful body, from which the committee chooses the general secretary and other “pillars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intraparty jockeying for power has been going on for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaks and internal discussion of the most significant choices suggest that the congress will produce a mix of continuity and a sharper tilt toward rapid economic reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, 67, a police general and former intelligence officer, is expected to retire and be replaced by Le Minh Hung, 55, the youngest member of the Politburo. He has a background in finance and is a former governor of the State Bank of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last of the four “pillars,” Tran Thanh Man, 63, is expected to stay in his post as the chair of the National Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of those expecting promotion at the provincial and ministry levels have ties to Mr. Lam’s home province of Hung Yen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party plans to draw up a new model for economic growth, to rely less on low-skilled labor, and more on science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vietnam is still facing very major challenges, including the risk of falling further behind economically, failing to adapt quickly enough to climate change and environmental degradation,” according to a party report set to be presented at the congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That report said Vietnam would seek strategic projects with other countries because “with some important partners, trust remains low, uneven and not truly sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That appeared to be a reference to the United States. A trade deal with Washington still hasn’t been finalized. Despite the strain of tariffs, Vietnam’s economic growth topped 8 percent last year, in large part because Chinese factories have moved into Vietnam at a rapid pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country’s main challenge lies with implementing policies that build more openness, efficiency and competition, analysts say. Internally, an oligarchy of state-favored firms with low productivity represent one danger. U.S. trade tensions and a surge of Chinese factories — heavily subsidized by Beijing — also threaten to keep Vietnam from its goal of developing a strong domestic industrial economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent congresses, policy adjustments had often been incremental. This year, many Vietnamese are hoping for more decisive moves as the forces of stability and urgency compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-speed train ran off its track and crashed into another high-speed train late Sunday in southern Spain, killing at least 21 people and injuring dozens of others, according to the local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accident is the deadliest train accident in Spainsince 2013, when 80 people died after a train veered off a curved section of track in the country’s northwest. The country has the second-longest high-speed rail network in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collision on Sunday occurred at 7:45 p.m. in Adamuz, in the southern province of Córdoba. The train that derailed first was a privately-operated one that was traveling to Madrid from Málaga, on the country’s southern coast. The rear cars of that train fell into the opposite track, where it collided with an incoming train operated by Spain’s national rail company, which was bound for the southern city of Huelva, west of Seville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iryo, the operator of the first train, said that around 300 passengers were on board at the time of the crash. Renfe, the operator of the second train, has not said how many passengers it was carrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain’s state-owned rail infrastructure agency said in a statement that rail traffic between Madrid and several major cities in southern Andalucía — including Córdoba, Seville, Málaga and Huelva — will be suspended on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergency response crews continued to search through the wreckage of the crash early Monday, with officials warning that the death toll may rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the 2013 disaster, the derailment on Sunday happened on a straight portion of the track. An independent commission has been launched to investigate what caused it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Óscar Puente, Spain’s transport minister, told reporters that the first train to derail was only a few years old and that the section of the track where the accident occurred had been recently renovated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The accident is extremely strange,” he said. “It happened on a straightaway. All the experts we have consulted are extremely baffled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: “If there had not been an oncoming train, we would not be talking about casualties of any type.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain expressed sympathy for the victims’ families on social media, saying that “the entire country stands with them in this extremely difficult moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tonight is a night of deep pain for our country,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Andalucía government has set up a medical post at the crash site for victims, while the Córdoba city government has issued an urgent appeal for doctors to help treat the injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paco Carmona, the director of Córdoba’s fire brigade, told public television that emergency crews were prioritizing assistance for victims still trapped in the two carriages most severely damaged in the crash.&lt;/p&gt;
