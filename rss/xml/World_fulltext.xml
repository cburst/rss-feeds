&lt;p&gt;Trump threatened heavy tariffs on countries standing between him and Greenland. E.U. leaders are scrambling for a response.&lt;/p&gt;

A high-speed train smashed into another train after derailing in the southern province of Córdoba, officials said. The cause of the accident was not immediately clear.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18int-tariffs-retaliate-fzkp/18int-tariffs-retaliate-fzkp-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with the threat of punishing tariffs by President Trump if he does not get his way over acquiring Greenland, European Union leaders began to coalesce around a negotiation strategy on Sunday, without ruling out retaliatory taxes of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump on Saturday had demanded a deal to buy Greenland, saying on social media that otherwise he would slap tariffs on a group of European nations, starting with 10 percent in February, then ramping up to 25 percent in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, ambassadors from across the 27-nation bloc met in Brussels to take stock of the situation. While those were just preliminary talks, they made a few things clear. Officials would rather negotiate than retaliate, for one. But they are also committed to protecting Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, from being bought or taken over if that is not what its people want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration showed no signs of backing down. In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that European leaders would eventually understand that American control of Greenland would be “best for Greenland, best for Europe and best for the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The European leaders will come around,” Mr. Bessent said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Washington continues to escalate its efforts, European officials could also consider hitting back, two diplomats familiar with the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials are entertaining the possibility of allowing a list of retaliatory tariffs worth 93 billion euros, or $107 billion — drawn up during last year’s trade war — to take effect in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some members of the European Parliament and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, have suggested that the European Union should activate an even more drastic tool: A never-used weapon intended to combat economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That option — officially called the “anti-coercion instrument,” and unofficially referred to as Europe’s trade “bazooka” — could be used to slap restrictions on big American technology companies or other service providers that conduct large amounts of business on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would not be a first resort, the diplomats said, because it would risk escalating the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the European Union’s options are likely to be up for discussion later this week, when leaders gather in Brussels. António Costa, the president of the European Council, which gives the European Union political direction, announced on Sunday that he had “decided to convene an extraordinary meeting” of European leaders in the coming days. An E.U. official added that the meeting might be in person, and that it could take place on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a session would allow prime ministers and presidents from across the bloc to discuss how they might respond to Mr. Trump. It would also come just as, or before, many European policymakers head to Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Forum. Mr. Trump is also planning to attend, creating a chance for conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many European leaders are still hoping they might be able to talk things out, discussions have essentially been futile so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe has been hesitant to retaliate against the United States, in part because it relies on America for military technologies and support for NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Brando Benifei, a member of the European Parliament and the chair of its delegation for U.S. relations, said that calculus may be shifting, in part because popular opinion in Europe has turned more critical of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are saying that we are clearly over a red line,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain spoke to Mr. Trump on Sunday and told him that “applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is wrong,” a Downing Street spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, told reporters on Sunday that she had also spoken to Mr. Trump and called the proposed tariffs a “mistake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Rutte, the secretary-general of NATO, said on social media that he, too, had spoken with Mr. Trump about Greenland, but provided few details, saying only that “we will continue working on this” and that he looked forward to seeing Mr. Trump at Davos this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House did not immediately comment on the spate of calls, which come a day after Mr. Trump’s announcement of new tariffs was met with unified outrage by U.S. allies. Several of those allies, including Britain, France and Germany, released a forceful joint statement with Denmark on Sunday that decried the tariff threats, saying that they “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-signers of the statement, all NATO countries, said they would continue to stand in solidarity with Greenland and vowed to remain “united and coordinated in our response.” The statement was later endorsed by several other European countries, including Iceland, Latvia and Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/18/multimedia/18spain-crash-WWK-gkcq/18spain-crash-WWK-gkcq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high-speed train ran off its track and crashed into another high-speed train late Sunday in southern Spain, killing at least 21 people and injuring dozens of others, according to the local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accident is the deadliest train accident in Spainsince 2013, when 80 people died after a train veered off a curved section of track in the country’s northwest. The country has the second-longest high-speed rail network in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collision on Sunday occurred at 7:45 p.m. in Adamuz, in the southern province of Córdoba. The train that derailed first was a privately-operated one that was traveling to Madrid from Málaga, on the country’s southern coast. The rear cars of that train fell into the opposite track, where it collided with an incoming train operated by Spain’s national rail company, which was bound for the southern city of Huelva, west of Seville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iryo, the operator of the first train, said that around 300 passengers were on board at the time of the crash. Renfe, the operator of the second train, has not said how many passengers it was carrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain’s state-owned rail infrastructure agency said in a statement that rail traffic between Madrid and several major cities in southern Andalucía — including Córdoba, Seville, Málaga and Huelva — will be suspended on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergency response crews continued to search through the wreckage of the crash early Monday, with officials warning that the death toll may rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the 2013 disaster, the derailment on Sunday happened on a straight portion of the track. An independent commission has been launched to investigate what caused it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Óscar Puente, Spain’s transport minister, told reporters that the first train to derail was only a few years old and that the section of the track where the accident occurred had been recently renovated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The accident is extremely strange,” he said. “It happened on a straightaway. All the experts we have consulted are extremely baffled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: “If there had not been an oncoming train, we would not be talking about casualties of any type.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain expressed sympathy for the victims’ families on social media, saying that “the entire country stands with them in this extremely difficult moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tonight is a night of deep pain for our country,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Andalucía government has set up a medical post at the crash site for victims, while the Córdoba city government has issued an urgent appeal for doctors to help treat the injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paco Carmona, the director of Córdoba’s fire brigade, told public television that emergency crews were prioritizing assistance for victims still trapped in the two carriages most severely damaged in the crash.&lt;/p&gt;

For President Trump, the sheer size of Greenland’s territory holds part of the appeal; it is about three times the size of Texas, and bigger than Alaska.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19int-uk-harry-explainer-ghjb/19int-uk-harry-explainer-ghjb-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince Harry’s latest legal case in Britain is set to begin on Monday in London’s High Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prince and several other high-profile figures are accusing Associated Newspapers, the publisher of The Daily Mail, of unlawful information gathering, including phone hacking, and of intruding into their private lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is set to last for more than two months, and Harry is scheduled to testify on Thursday. The other claimants include Elton John and his husband, David Furnish, the actresses Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, a former British government minister, and a racial justice campaigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry and the other claimants accuse the company of carrying out or commissioning unlawful activities to reveal private information about their lives for articles published from 1997 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written arguments presented at a preliminary hearing in May said there had been “clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering by private investigators” hired by Associated Newspapers, with “payments spanning decades” and involvement by newspaper executives and numerous journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private investigators are accused of hacking and tapping phones, placing listening devices in cars and “blagging” — a way of tricking people into handing over information — to obtain phone numbers, personal records and bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper group, which owns The Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday and several other titles that are not implicated in the case, has denied all the accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a preliminary hearing on Thursday, four days before the trial was to start, a lawyer for Associated Newspapers, Anthony White, said he would argue that some of the claimants’ witnesses “are not telling the truth” and that he would raise questions about their credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associated Newspapers said in a statement that its journalists had not commissioned or obtained information derived from illegal activity and called the accusations “preposterous and without foundation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added, “The stories concerned, many of which were published 20 or more years ago, and not subject to any complaint at the time, were the product of responsible journalism based on legitimate sources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a schedule jointly drawn up by both legal teams, the trial will run for more than two months and end on March 26. The judge hearing the case, Matthew Nicklin, is expected to consider the evidence and arguments before giving a ruling at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case will begin with lawyers for the claimants and Associated Newspapers giving an outline of their case. Prince Harry is expected to give evidence in person at the High Court on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elton John, the other claimants and witnesses, including Ms. Frost’s former husband, the actor Jude Law, are also set to be questioned by lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private investigators accused of wrongdoing will appear at the trial, as will the former editor of The Daily Mail, Paul Dacre, and several past and present Associated Newspapers executives and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is one of several pursued by Harry since 2020, when he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped down from their royal roles and left Britain, later making their home in Montecito, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have centered on accusations of press intrusion, which Harry said was a key reason behind their decision to move. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, Harry said that he feared “history repeating itself,” referring to the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a car crash while she was being chased by paparazzi in Paris in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said there was an “invisible contract” between Britain’s royal family and the country’s tabloids, adding, “There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of The Daily Mirror, another tabloid, settled a claim over phone hacking in February 2024. During that case, Harry became the first senior royal to testify in court since 1891.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers agreed to pay a “substantial” amount of damages to Harry to settle a long-running lawsuit relating to articles in The Sun and the long-closed News of the World. News Group apologized for “serious intrusion” into Harry’s personal life between 1996 and 2011 and admitted for the first time to unlawful activities by private investigators working for The Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry lost an unrelated legal battle last May over his publicly funded security in Britain, which was downgraded after his decision to step back from royal duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But late last year, the government body responsible for royal security decisions began a review of his protection arrangements, according to two people familiar with the situation who were not given permission to speak publicly. The review appears to offer a glimmer of good news for the prince, who has spoken of his desire to visit Britain with his family if his automatic right to security is reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19int-europe-alliance01-photo-jbtp/19int-europe-alliance01-photo-jbtp-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens to an 80-year-old diplomatic alliance when its leading power threatens a military invasion of one member, wages economic war on the others and vows to cultivate political and cultural resistance to their governments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the alliance doomed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question is being asked in capitals across Europe as leaders rush to respond to President Trump’s rapidly escalating campaign to acquire Greenland over the objections of the people who live there. At issue most urgently is whether resisting Mr. Trump’s territorial ambitions risks damaging Europe’s relationship with the United States beyond repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some leaders — like President Emmanuel Macron of France and Lars Klingbeil, Germany’s finance minister — appear willing to take that risk, urging Europe’s nations to consider deploying an economic “bazooka” in response to Mr. Trump’s latest tariff threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders from across Europe are expected to gather in Brussels this week to present a united response to Mr. Trump’s provocations. Veteran observers of European politics said the alliance between Europe and the United States that formed in the aftermath of World War II had already been fundamentally altered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no longer an alliance designed primarily to advance the interests of like-minded democracies, they said. Instead, it is a relationship on Mr. Trump’s terms alone — one in which he wields the leverage that comes from American power to force Europeans to cater to his whims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To use what is essentially economic warfare with allies is unprecedented in this way,” said Ian Lesser, who leads the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund, a research group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appears to be a consensus in much of Europe that it needs to build new economic and military capacities to make it less dependent on the United States. But that will take years, if not decades. In the meantime, Europe’s businesses and financial markets will still be intertwined with the buying power of consumers in the United States, and Ukraine will still need American weapons to defend itself against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, months of diplomatic effort to negotiate a cease-fire in the Ukraine war have only underscored that NATO, which was formed to defend Europe, is unable to fend off Russian aggression without security guarantees by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”It would be foolish at a time of war in Europe to jettison all of the sort of strategic and operational benefits that come with the alliance,” Mr. Lesser said. “But if the United States is no longer a reliable partner in that alliance, then Europe needs to do something else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That effort is already underway, slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day that Mr. Trump announced his latest tariff threat on social media, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, and António Costa, the president of the European Council, were in Paraguay to sign a major trade deal with a bloc of Latin American countries, one that was 25 years in the making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has so far been happy to welcome European money to purchase American-made arms for Ukraine and other countries in Eastern Europe. And he relishes surprising his so-called allies, as he demonstrated on Saturday when he announced tariffs on a group of European nations, including Britain, unless Greenland is sold to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our economics reporters — based in New York, London, Brussels, Berlin, Hong Kong and Seoul — are digging into every aspect of the tariffs causing global turmoil. They are joined by dozens of reporters writing about the effects on everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That raises the stakes for the decisions that Europe is grappling with in the days ahead. It must choose how aggressively to confront Mr. Trump without knowing what the always-unpredictable president will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is he serious? What does Europe do now? How does the U.S. respond?” Mr. Lesser said. “There will be those who say, ‘OK, how do we get through this? Is it possible to simply to engage in a kind of negotiation or investment or whatever it may be, that will defer anything radical?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has already made it clear that he views America’s European allies with disdain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his annual National Security Strategy, released last month, officials from Mr. Trump’s administration questioned whether some European countries would remain “reliable allies” in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document conceded that Europe was “strategically and culturally vital” to the United States. But it said the continent faced the “stark prospect of civilizational erasure” unless the United States helped like-minded “patriotic European parties” — a phrase that was widely understood to mean the far right — to win power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Europeans on the receiving end of those assertions, the president’s threats about acquiring Greenland “the easy way” or “the hard way” have further eroded the trust that was central to their alliance with the United States for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Going back to the level of trust that we saw beforehand would require, I think, generational change,” said Rosa Balfour, the director of Carnegie Europe, a political think tank. “The attack on Europe is not just coming from an individual, you know — it’s been turned into an ideology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the latest Greenland threats, more voices have begun urging assertive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement over the weekend, Mr. Macron vowed that “no intimidation or threat will influence us — neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called Mr. Trump’s tariff threats “unacceptable” and vowed: “Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, like Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, have argued for a diplomatic solution and cautioned against grandstanding. “That’s an understandable instinct, but it’s not effective,” the prime minister told reporters on Monday morning. “It never has been. It may make politicians feel good, but it does nothing for working people whose jobs, livelihoods and security rely on the relationships that we build across the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Ms. Balfour said that more leaders were beginning to realize that capitulating to Mr. Trump’s demands was not always in Europe’s interests. In fact, it often leads Mr. Trump to demand more concessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If true, that could have implications for the alliance with the United States and whether it survives in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reality, I think, is sinking into the mind-sets of those people who have been advocating caution, dialogue and ‘Let’s listen to what Trump has to say,’” Ms. Balfour said. “You can feel that kind of change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19trump-norway-sub-vwjf/19trump-norway-sub-vwjf-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump is now claiming that one reason he is pushing to acquire Greenland is that he didn’t win the Nobel Peace Prize, according to a text message he sent to Norway’s prime minister over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonas Gahr Store, Norway’s leader, received the text message on Sunday, an official in the prime minister’s office said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Mr. Trump wrote in the message, which was first published by PBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump also questioned Denmark’s claim to Greenland, saying, “There are no written documents,” and adding, “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tensions over Greenland have sharply escalated in the last week, and the message injected a new level of uncertainty into Mr. Trump’s thinking and his campaign to gain control of the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland has been part of the Danish Kingdom for more than 300 years, and world leaders have condemned Mr. Trump’s insistence that the United States take over the territory, a giant icebound island in the Arctic region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to copies of the messages provided by the Norwegian prime minister’s office, Mr. Trump’s message was a response to one that Mr. Store sent Mr. Trump on Sunday. It was co-signed by the president of Finland, Alexander Stubb, a leader with whom Mr. Trump is close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European leaders asked to speak to Mr. Trump about Greenland and his threat of using tariffs to pressure Denmark into selling it, which Denmark has refused to do. They asked for a phone call and struck a collaborative tone, writing, “We believe we all should work to take this down and de-escalate — so much is happening around us where we need to stand together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Mr. Trump’s response, Mr. Store said in a statement, “As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have on several occasions clearly explained to Trump what is well known, namely that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, that awards the prize,” Mr. Store said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has repeatedly challenged Denmark’s claims to Greenland, but in decades-old agreements that the United States has signed with Denmark, the United States has recognized Denmark’s close connection to the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2004 amendment to an older defense pact between Denmark and the United States, which grants the United States broad military access, explicitly recognizes Greenland as “an equal part of the Kingdom of Denmark.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in 1916, Denmark sold what are now the U.S. Virgin Islands to the United States for $25 million in gold. In the treaty for that deal, a clause reads, “The United States of America will not object to the Danish Government extending their political and economic interests to the whole of Greenland.”In the past year, as Mr. Trump has repeatedly vowed to “get” Greenland, Denmark has repeatedly rebuffed him. Denmark’s position is that it does not have the authority to sell the self-governing territory and that Greenland’s 57,000 inhabitants will decide their own fate. Polls and interviews show that an overwhelming majority of Greenlanders strongly oppose joining the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Greenlanders staged the biggest protest of recent months. Hundreds marched through the snowy streets of Nuuk, the capital, chanting, “No means no,” “Greenland is already great” and “Yankee, go home!”In the past few days, Denmark and other European countries have sent more military forces to the island. Small groups of Danish soldiers dressed in green camouflage and dark woolen hats have been walking through downtown Nuuk. Beyond the harbor, a 200-foot-long Danish warship capable of breaking through ice has been patrolling the shoreline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much-anticipated three-way meeting last week of the United States, Denmark and Greenland, hosted by Vice President JD Vance in Washington, did not produce any breakthroughs and seemed to instead create misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time Greenland had been included in a such high-level discussions, and the Danish and Greenlandic officials left saying that a working group had been formed to explore possibilities for a solution. But the Trump administration said afterwards that the two sides would begin “technical talks on the acquisition of Greenland,” a statement that raised even more concern in Greenland, in Denmark and across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/07/XX-Syria-Destruction-Visual-60268-cover/XX-Syria-Destruction-Visual-60268-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Syria, the destruction from 13 years of war has become part of the landscape. There is barely a town or city undamaged, or a community untouched, in the sprawling country of 23 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the main cities like Damascus, the capital, entire neighborhoods and suburbs were pulverized as the dictator Bashar al-Assad and Russia and Iran, his allies, sought to crush an armed rebellion that emerged from the 2011 Arab Spring uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fighting and repression forced more than half of the population to flee their homes. They left behind ghost towns, whole sections of cities where block after block remains shrouded in darkness and uninhabitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebels eventually toppled the regime in December 2024. Focused on consolidating power, the new government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa has barely begun the task of clearing and rebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over three million Syrians have already returned since Mr. al-Assad fled and took refuge in Russia. Many are living in the ruins, or in a tent beside them. Some have patched up an apartment perched halfway up the empty skeleton of a residential block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient city of Aleppo and its surrounding province experienced some of the most extensive damage through the years of war — and has been the site of recent clashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front line ran through the fabled old city, renowned for its courtyard houses and covered souk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were fighting over it,” said Razan Abdulwahab, an architect coordinating projects in the area for the U.N.-Habitat, the United Nations urban development program. “It is a big disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty percent of the old city was destroyed, including many buildings registered as antiquities, she said. Even as work is underway to restore parts of the souk, the old city remains a horrifying landscape of dust and rubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot forget that day, looking at all the damage,” said Abdul Qadir, a trader who returned in 2017 to find his business and home near the old city destroyed. “Why? For what?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Syrians are struggling to survive. A third of all housing in the country is damaged or destroyed. Unemployment is high, and 90 percent of Syrians are living in poverty, according to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.N.-Habitat survey found that 31 percent of housing stock needs to be rebuilt or restored, leaving the country shy 1.9 million homes for roughly 10 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strain is visible. In the southwestern city of Dara’a, a cradle of the Syrian uprising in 2011, neighborhoods that supported the rebellion lie decimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some places, the rubble is so deep that people cannot find where their houses once stood, said Muhammad Kheir Bajbuj, 50. Sometimes, they cannot even find the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only two houses are occupied on his street, his own and that of a cousin, who returned with her family after a charity helped repair her roof. “Very few people came back because most of us have no money,” Mr. Bajbuj said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the main cities, villages and towns are littered with land mines and unexploded bombs. The explosives are killing and maiming those who return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One afternoon last summer in Deir al-Zour, in eastern Syria, a woman and her teenage son set off an explosion as they were scavenging in a trash dump. The mother was killed and the boy was badly injured in the face and eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deir al-Zour has been described as the most heavily damaged city in Syria by U.N.-Habitat. Traffic weaves past craters and around mounds of rubble. Children play in the ruins beneath great slabs of concrete hanging perilously from buildings. Dust clogs the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like much of eastern Syria, Deir al-Zour suffered the additional trial of being subjugated by the Islamic State, or ISIS. Its roads and bridges are broken. Its churches and mosques are reduced to rubble. Schools and hospitals are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task to rebuild is immense. Housing alone will cost $80 billion, U.N.-Habitat estimates. The World Bank has put Syria’s reconstruction costs at an estimated $216 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is still no talk of putting together a comprehensive economic reconstruction plan,” the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reported recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Trump administration and many other Western donors cutting international assistance budgets, Syria’s government is seeking money from the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That bears its own risks, experts warned. If not handled fairly, private-sector-led reconstruction can lead to renewed cronyism and social inequality that could create more instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we really want stability, reconstruction support has to be provided,” said Hiroshi Takabayashi, the head of the country program in Syria for U.N.-Habitat. Syria was a cornerstone for stability for much of the Middle East, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we fail here,” he said, “this whole world order may not be sustained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After so much loss and destruction, Syrians do not ask for much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who will give me compensation? Who will pay us back for the people we lost, the money we lost?” said Kadri Musalli, a storekeeper in Deir al-Zour, who said his brother bled out on the street under shellfire during the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can climb back up and achieve civilized growth,” he said, “but it will be very, very slow.”&lt;/p&gt;
