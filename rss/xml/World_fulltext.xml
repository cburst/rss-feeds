&lt;p&gt;A 12-year-old boy died on Saturday after being bitten in both legs by a large shark at a beach near Sydney earlier this week, the authorities said, amid heightened concern in Australia following a recent spate of shark encounters at popular beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy, Nico Antic, was attacked on Sunday afternoon by what the authorities believe was a bull shark after he jumped from a popular 20-foot rock ledge at a beach in Vaucluse, a Sydney suburb. His parents, Lorena and Juan, confirmed his death in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident came in a period of increased shark activity during peak summer season along Australia’s southeastern coast. The attack on Nico Antic was the first of four shark encounters on the New South Wales coast over a 48-hour period earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, a shark bit a boy’s surfboard and a few miles away another surfer was bitten on the leg. On Tuesday, a shark knocked a surfer off his board, leaving him hospitalized with minor injuries. The authorities closed more than a dozen beaches in northern Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shark encounters increase in summer but attacks are rare in Australia. Scientists have said, however, that recent heavy rain runoff and warmer temperatures have drawn sharks closer to shore by bringing prey and nutrients into coastal waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials in New South Wales state, of which Sydney is the capital, have urged swimmers and surfers to follow beach closure notices and exercise caution. They have also advised people to stay close to shore, avoid murky water and swim or surf with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police said they received a report at 4:15 p.m. on Sunday that a boy had been bitten by a shark. One of his friends jumped into the water to rescue him, and two others pulled him onto the shore, Superintendent Joe McNulty, commander of the police force’s Marine Area Command, told reporters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers found the boy unconscious and applied two tourniquets to stop the bleeding from his legs, Superintendent McNulty said. They performed C.P.R. as they took him by boat to shore, where paramedics transported him by ambulance to a children’s hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giles Buchanan, an ambulance inspector in New South Wales, said that the boy received several blood transfusions before arriving at the hospital and was in critical condition after undergoing surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police said that the boy died at the hospital on Saturday afternoon, without naming him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/23/multimedia/23dc-greenland-security-01-kmjq/23dc-greenland-security-01-kmjq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen years ago, a Chinese icebreaker called the Snow Dragon made a long and surprising voyage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over three months in the summer, the scientific research vessel crossed from the Pacific to the Atlantic, traversing nearly 5,400 nautical miles of the Arctic Ocean, a first for China. The crew discovered that melting ice meant the ship could travel through the remote region without great difficulty, the expedition leader told reporters after docking in Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To our astonishment,” said the leader, Huigen Yang, “most part of the Northern Sea Route is open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American and European officials took notice at the time and began keeping a close watch on China’s moves in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while China has talked about expanding trade and access to shipping lanes and natural resources in the Arctic, it has developed only a small footprint there over the years. And even as China and Russia compete with the United States in many parts of the world, they do not present a threat to American interests in or near Greenland, say experts on those two superpowers and current and former U.S. officials, including intelligence analysts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those findings contrast sharply with assertions by President Trump, who has repeatedly cited security as the reason he wants to acquire Greenland. In a speech on Wednesday at an annual forum in Davos, Switzerland, he said Greenland was an “enormous, unsecured island” that was a “core national security interest of the United States of America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been our policy for hundreds of years to prevent outside threats from entering our hemisphere, and we’ve done it very successfully,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a meeting on Jan. 14 in Washington, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio asked the Danish foreign minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, and the foreign minister of Greenland, Vivian Motzfeldt, whether Denmark had the resources to protect Greenland against any potential future threat from China, Mr. Rasmussen said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Mr. Trump and his aides have not presented any intelligence that points to Chinese threats to Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has increased its collaboration with Russia on maritime patrols and long-range bomber patrols in the vast Arctic region, said Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich, the top NATO commander in Europe. But allied officials say there is no looming threat, and in any case Greenland falls under the NATO security umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any problems were to emerge, the United States could expand its military presence in Greenland under a 1951 U.S.-Denmark pact. Denmark, which has sovereignty over the autonomous island, has said it would welcome more American troops. The United States had about 10,000 troops in Greenland during the Cold War, 50 times more than the 200 there now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although China does have a long-term goal of projecting naval power globally, it is focused on building up its military for deployment mainly in the Asia-Pacific region, where it is vying with the United States for dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regarding China, there’s no military activity near Greenland,” said John Culver, a former intelligence analyst on China who briefed Mr. Trump in his first term. “If this administration had any intel about actual threats, it would be leaked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never read anything that shows China has military designs on Greenland,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who receives regular briefings from U.S. intelligence officials, expressed a similar view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let me be clear: As vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I’m closely tracking the facts, and there is no current military threat from Russia or China to Greenland,” he said on Thursday in a statement to The New York Times. “The only immediate threat right now is from the United States, with talk of taking territory from one of our closest allies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Denmark has been clear: If we want expanded military access or greater cooperation on critical minerals, they’re open to it, but it must be done in partnership, not through intimidation and saber rattling,” Mr. Warner added. “When we create chaos with our allies, we weaken America’s ability to meet real global threats and make ourselves less safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China and Russia collect some intelligence near Greenland and in the Arctic that is focused mostly on activities at the U.S. military’s Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, an American official said. And Russian submarines and other military assets have sailed near Greenland. But neither country has threatened Greenland’s sovereignty or security, said that official and another U.S. official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former U.S. officials said that during the Biden administration, there were no major intelligence reports about Russian or Chinese activities near Greenland. And Western intelligence officials said no significant activity was reported in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Culver said China is not an Arctic power yet in any real sense. And in any case, China does not need Greenland or to get close to the American mainland to launch nuclear warheads at the continental United States. The same goes for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, China’s first domestic-built icebreaker, the Snow Dragon Two, completed an Arctic expedition. (The original Snow Dragon was built in Ukraine during the Soviet era.) China now has a handful of icebreakers, but commercial Chinese vessels going through the region rely on Russian icebreakers and Russian outposts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What China wants is to have certain rights in the Arctic, including ones related to navigation, natural resource extraction and environmental management, Mr. Culver said. Discussions about those issues often take place at meetings of the Arctic Council, a multilateral organization established in 1996 whose eight full members include the United States and Russia. China has observer status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some former U.S. officials said they were concerned about the strains that Mr. Trump’s push to control Greenland was putting on relations between the United States and its European allies, and how the tensions weakened the ability of those nations to challenge or deter Chinese or Russian ambitions across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We already have de facto control in Greenland,” said Rush Doshi, a former China director on the Biden White House’s National Security Council. “The marginal increase in control we might get from taking the territory threatens to blow up our relations with important allies and partners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those relations are needed for the United States and its allies to work together to re-industrialize at scale in order to compete with China, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Doshi said China does seek to make commercial inroads in the Arctic, but the United States can address those in talks with allies and partners. And any Arctic challenge from China, he said, is “less significant than the Soviet threat during the Cold War. And even during the Cold War, we didn’t militarily seize Greenland. If we didn’t seize it then, what’s the reason to seize it now?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has mentioned that Greenland has critical minerals, which are important for civilian and military uses. Last year, Chinese leaders threatened to impose bans on exports of its processed rare earths and critical minerals to the United States, which compelled Mr. Trump to back down from his trade war with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has said that having access to the raw minerals is not the main issue for the United States, but rather having the ability to process and refine them. China has a global monopoly on that production, and U.S. territorial control of Greenland would not change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Russia, it has been an Arctic power since the Cold War, but it does not pose an immediate threat to Greenland, said Fiona Hill, a senior director for Russian and European affairs in the first Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trump has become obsessed with owning it,” she said. “He wants the greatest land deal in history — that’s the context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first Trump term, a billionaire friend of the president, Ronald S. Lauder, mentioned to Mr. Trump the idea of acquiring Greenland, and from then on Mr. Trump became fixated on the territory, Ms. Hill said, confirming earlier reports. Ms. Hill said she and other White House officials began working on a memo with legally viable proposals, including basing more troops on the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump’s statements in interviews about his personal desire to acquire Greenland underscore the idea that the concern over security appears to be a pretext. It is similar to how he cited drug smuggling from Venezuela last fall as the rationale for his renewed aggression against that country when the actual core reason turned out to be his drive for its oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about Greenland, Mr. Trump said in a Times interview this month that taking it was “psychologically important for me.” And in 2021, he told the authors of the book “The Divider” that he needed to acquire the island because it was “massive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Doshi said, “Is this really about China and Russia, or is the discussion of China and Russia masking the reality of what is behind the drive for Greenland, which is an imperial project based on vanity?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julian E. Barnes contributed reporting from Washington, and Adam Goldman from Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24Insider-Spain-train-crash-vwjc/24Insider-Spain-train-crash-vwjc-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call came from an editor in London last Monday morning. Could I get to the scene of a deadly train crash in southern Spain? I checked flights from Barcelona, where I live, grabbed my cameras and rushed to the airport. During my flight and a two-hour drive to the town of Adamuz, where two high-speed trains had collided, I considered what I needed to capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would reach the scene 22 hours after the crash, once survivors had been evacuated and the wounded taken to faraway hospitals. Most of the bodies had been retrieved. Their relatives were privately undertaking the grim task of identifying remains, mostly through DNA testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first responsibility as journalists covering a disaster lies with the victims and their families. Their testimony is important to understanding what has happened and what it means. But we must avoid compounding people’s trauma or deepening their pain. I would arrive too late to photograph those most affected, and for that I was quietly relieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve covered countless conflicts and disasters throughout my career, including wars in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Gaza, and Sudan, a plane crash in Cameroon that killed 114 people, the immediate aftermath of Russian strikes on civilians in Ukraine, and, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, an Ebola outbreak, a volcanic eruption and massacres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such situations, we weigh the risks — both physical and emotional — to ourselves and to those we are documenting. We are up against the demand for news, competing with large networks of photographers working for the news wire services, as well as the unchecked flow of social media information and misinformation. Official accounts need to be verified. The Times relies on teams of reporters, editors, photographers and graphics editors to deliver detailed, deeply reported and accurate information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main role in reporting on disasters is to document what happened and ask tough questions. My job on this assignment was to provide visuals illustrating the extensive reporting being done by my colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of the crash was a mystery. It occurred on a straight stretch of track. The authorities said the trains and the tracks had recently been maintained. Taking a forensic approach, I knew I’d need to photograph as many angles of the wreckage as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem: The authorities had closed off much of the surrounding area, blocking media access from the direction of Adamuz, east of the tracks. I approached from the west, driving up a winding back road through the spectacular Parque Natural Sierra de Hornachuelos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I crested a ridge, I saw in the distance a stalled train — a slash of red cutting across rugged green hills. When I got closer, emergency and construction crews were working on the other side of the tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crash site was obscured by the terrain, so I walked up a nearby hill for a better view. I passed no police lines or cordons. On the hilltop, I reached above a chain-link fence to snap a few frames of the overturned carriages. Then, a drone buzzed me several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took this to mean I should leave the area. I walked back to my car, where two members of the Guardia Civil law enforcement agency inspected my press pass and ID before politely asking me to move along. I complied. One of my photos from the hilltop was published on the front page of The Times the following day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still need more pictures of the scene, so I set out before dawn the next morning looking for views from the opposite side of the tracks. Without encountering any police cordon, and keeping my distance from the crash site, I walked through steep forest trails for several hours, crossing streams and crawling through undergrowth. I found a vantage point in some bushes far enough away to avoid interfering with the investigation while offering a partial view of the second train, which had come to rest about 2,000 feet from the wreck I photographed the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was soon joined by another photographer from the Reuters news agency. After a few hours, we left. Looking for a shorter route back to my car, I stumbled through some bushes and emerged at the edge of a sun-dappled stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before me, partly submerged at the edge of the stream, was a large piece of metal. At first I thought it was just junk — it was not cordoned off like the rest of the wreckage — but I quickly put things together in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That front page photo showed that something was missing from the underside of the train — something much like the debris in front of me. Could this piece provide a critical clue to what went wrong? And were the authorities aware that it was sitting here, half-submerged and unmarked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that it could be important evidence, I kept my distance, took a few pictures, then climbed away, not wanting to disturb the area. I sent the photos to my colleagues, who swiftly informed the authorities while beginning their own investigation. The publication of our story and photos ignited a firestorm across Spanish media and raised questions about the thoroughness of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked for official comment, the authorities said they knew about the debris, without answering questions about when they became aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister of transportation, Óscar Puente, told Spain’s state broadcaster that the undercarriage had been located on Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after my discovery — and three days after the crash — the authorities shared photographs of their investigators marking the site and documenting the undercarriage. They have not responded to questions about when the photographs were taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24canadaletter-carney-lghc/24canadaletter-carney-lghc-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his many trips to the World Economic Forum as a central banker and later as an investment executive, Prime Minister Mark Carney made some significant deals, but always in private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his first trip as Canada’s prime minister to the annual gathering of billionaires, investors, chief executives and politicians, Mr. Carney stole the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in the group of journalists who traveled to Davos with Mr. Carney. We had been given the text of his speech under embargo to allow us draft reports of our articles that we would adjust to reflect the prime minister’s delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most of you know probably know by now, while Mr. Carney did not refer to President Trump by name, the speech took direct aim at the U.S. leader and his policies. After declaring that the United States had created an irrevocable “rupture” in the world order, Mr. Carney warned that nations like Canada would now have to ally for survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The middle powers must act together, because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Read: Canada’s Prime Minister Says There Has Been a ‘Rupture’ in the World Order]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Read: Canada Flexes on Global Stage With an Eye to Its Own Survival]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Carney, unlike many other leaders, had not attempted to flatter Mr. Trump. But up until Davos, his responses to the president had always been carefully calibrated. So there was a buzz in the small newsroom for the reporters traveling with Mr. Carney after the embargoed text arrived. His gloves, it seemed, were off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, after a trip through security screening and down some exceptionally icy paths, followed by a long wait, we were ushered into the back corner of the main meeting hall to hear Mr. Carney speak. The lighting in the audience section of the hall was dim, and it was difficult to make out who was in attendance. But it was clear that even though the space was arena-sized, it was more an opera crowd than a bunch of hockey fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the spectators twice broke into applause after Mr. Carney called out Mr. Trump’s policies, particularly his desire to control Greenland. Then, at the end, they rose for a long standing ovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think I’ve seen many standing ovations in Davos,” Gideon Rachman, a columnist for The Financial Times, said before beginning an onstage interview with Mr. Carney. “That was interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I flew to Switzerland, it was anticipated that Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump would have some kind of meeting. That didn’t happen. When we were piling into vans taking journalists to the Zurich airport after a lunch break, Mr. Trump’s helicopter and its escorts were flying in the other direction to Davos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for Mr. Carney’s blunt talk was widespread, both within Canada and outside of its borders. David French, a Times Opinion columnist, wrote that the prime minister had “delivered what might be the most important address of Trump’s second term so far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[From Opinion: The Carney Doctrine]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his long and rambling speech a day later, Mr. Trump made it clear that he was not among Mr. Carney’s fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I watched your prime minister yesterday,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Carney. “He wasn’t so grateful — they should be grateful to us, Canada. Canada lives because of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Read: Trump Calls Out Mark Carney’s Davos Speech in Rebuke to Canada]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime minister had no immediate response. But on Thursday, less than a day after his return and before going into a cabinet meeting in Quebec City, Mr. Carney shot back at the president — again without naming him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Canada and the United States have built a remarkable partnership in the economy, in security and in rich cultural exchange,” Mr. Carney said in a speech that was largely devoted to domestic issues. “But Canada doesn’t live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Read: Mark Carney Says Firmly That ‘Canada Doesn’t Live Because of the United States’]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since Mr. Trump was re-elected to a second term, debate in Canada has largely focused on how to respond to things like the tariffs he placed on key Canadian industries and his obsession with making Canada the 51st state. There has been a pervasive view that pushing back too hard might further enrage Mr. Trump and make things worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the president’s response so far, aside from a veiled threat to Mr. Carney, has been limited to withdrawing Canada’s invitation to join the “Board of Peace,” a group that Mr. Trump founded to supervise a peace deal in Gaza between Israel and Hamas and which he is now attempting to turn into a rival to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Read: Trump Rescinds Canada’s Invitation to Join His ‘Board of Peace’]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than a punishment, however, the rescinding of that invitation may have come as a relief for Mr. Carney. In Davos, both Mr. Carney and François-Philippe Champagne, the finance minister, seemed uneasy about accepting and said that several details needed to be worked out. Among them, presumably, was Mr. Trump’s suggestion that its members would have to pay at least $1 billion each and the prospect that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia might also join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There remain, of course, many ways that Mr. Trump can continue to lash out at Canada. Above all, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — the free-trade pact known as U.S.M.C.A. — is now under review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this week, with the world watching, Mr. Carney pushed back against Mr. Trump, not once but twice. And it had the effect of heating both their rivalry and Mr. Carney’s global political stardom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A yearslong manhunt ended Friday, as the F.B.I. arrested Ryan Wedding, a former Canadian Olympic snowboarder who the law enforcement agency said is one of North America’s most notorious drug smugglers. He is charged with smuggling cocaine and other illicit drugs into the United States and Canada as well as ordering the assassination of a Canadian informant in Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheese had made Greensboro, a village in the northernmost part of Vermont, a destination for Canadian gourmets. But in the year since President Trump took office for the second time, that traffic from Canada has collapsed, Jenna Russell reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Jewish family that fled Iraq generations ago for Canada rented its home to France for use as an embassy. But after Iraq stripped Jews of property, the French government stopped paying rent. Now the family is suing France for $22 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American prosecutors have charged a former flight attendant from Toronto with wire fraud in connection with a scheme in which they say he posed as a pilot or a flight attendant to fly hundreds of times for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24themorning-nl/24themorning-nl-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed in an Airbnb recently and encountered the usual dysphoria one feels when occupying strangers’ homes: How can it be so difficult to unlock a front door, where are the lights, should I have taken my shoes off before running to the restroom, and, for me, the most perplexing, why is it so cold in here, and how on earth do I manipulate this weird thermostat? Regulating one’s temperature this time of year is, in much of the Northern Hemisphere, a fundamental challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O, to truly understand the sneaky calculus that determines “real feel” — the weather app said 40s, but I didn’t count on the wind! Layers, you tell yourself before leaving the house, but how many can one reasonably layer under a down parka before locomotion becomes impossible? I saw a headline from T Magazine and clicked eagerly, hoping it would solve things: “How to Stay Warm This Winter,” a list of luxurious accessories that promise to make things tolerable now that “we’ve reached the part of winter where it’s just you versus the elements.” I don’t know that I can justify cashmere earmuffs this year, but maybe over-the-knee socks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution, I’m told, is to become a tea person (the Brits just call this “a person”). Tea people, like sauna people, understand that warming oneself is not a layering challenge, but a cellular one. You could armor yourself with sealskin mittens and a down coat indistinguishable from a mountaineer’s sleeping bag, or you could mainline hot liquids and alter your temperature from the inside out. Tea people always have a mug going, a thermos at hand for refills. They carry out their all-day-long, all-day-strong warming ritual in the background, without the fanfare of coffee drinkers with their single-serving special orders. If they’re queried about their tea habits, they may, to the tea-ignorant, come off as a tad smug, like people with established yoga practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the late-2010s craze for “hygge,” the Danish concept of coziness and comfortable well-being? The Scandinavians, the rest of the world realized, might know a thing or two about optimizing for winter. They know from long, dark seasons, but still rank as the happiest people on the planet. Kari Leibowitz, a psychologist who moved north of the Arctic Circle to study how people thrive there during winter, wrote in The Times in 2020 that the secret is a “positive wintertime mind-set.” It’s possible, she found, to cultivate this, even if you’ve always associated the season with dread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mind-set shift involves changing what you notice, what you remark upon, where you place your focus. Leibowitz advises concentrating on what you like about winter (cooking, cozy indoor reading, the quiet after snowfall) over what you don’t (don’t get me started). “Appoint yourself a wintertime ambassador this year,” she advised, “and encourage everyone around you to notice what they like about the winter as well.” I imagine this self-designation might read as irritating to one’s shivering friends and family who would prefer to partake in the time-honored January tradition of complaining about the weather, but I’m already the unofficial publicist for summer, so maybe a new seasonal enthusiasm would read as refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leibowitz also advises people to get outside, to figure out the layering situation such that experiencing the Norwegian concept of “friluftsliv,” or “open air life,” isn’t excruciating. The Swedish author of “There’s No Such Thing as Bad Weather” (I think that sentence usually completes with “only bad clothes”) told Leibowitz, “There are some days when it’s harder to get outside than others, but I know that if I do, I’m never going to regret going outside.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah! That penetrates, doesn’t it? You’re never going to regret going outside. This is the sort of mantra that works on me. Every fiber of my being may disagree with it, but if I allow my brain to override the resistance, if I believe intellectually that it’s true, I’ll go out in the cold and quite possibly discover the physical and mental benefits of “outdoorphins.” If I can take a break from my usual winter pastimes of turning up the thermostat when no one is looking and making others touch and offer sympathy for my corpse-cold extremities, there’s a different relationship with winter awaiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re never going to regret going outside. No regrets, only possibility. You don’t have to make snow angels or take up cold-water swimming — just get your good clothes on and get out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, ICE agents patrolling Minneapolis collided with a car piloted by two teenagers. Agents detained the teens, and a crowd quickly formed. A local photographer texted Vincent Alban, a Times photography fellow covering Minneapolis. Alban sped over from a mile away and was taking pictures when ICE pushed one protester to the ground. With three agents on top of the demonstrator, another squirted pepper spray in his face. “The actual paper spray was an extremely fleeting moment, it couldn’t have been a second long,” Vincent recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, he and his camera were present. “The thing I love about photojournalism is that you have to be there in order to do your job,” he said. “It’s a firsthand account: What I’m seeing is what I’m photographing. With that I hope it’s seen as truthful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wide-scale protests against ICE shut down parts of Minneapolis-St. Paul yesterday. Thousands of demonstrators marched, hundreds of businesses closer their doors, and scores of workers and students stayed home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An F.B.I. agent who tried to investigate the ICE officer who shot Renee Good has resigned, after leadership pressured her to drop the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-china-military-mvfl/24int-china-military-mvfl-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China’s top general, second only to Xi Jinping, the nation’s leader, in the military command, has been put under investigation and accused of “grave violations of discipline and the law,” the Ministry of National Defense said on Saturday, the most stunning escalation yet in Mr. Xi’s purge of the People’s Liberation Army elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general, Zhang Youxia, is a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, the Communist Party body that controls China’s armed forces. Another member of the commission, Gen. Liu Zhenli, who leads the military’s Joint Staff Department, is also under investigation, the Defense Ministry said. Its announcement did not say what either general was alleged to have done wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang’s downfall — few if any Chinese officials placed publicly under investigation are later declared innocent — is the most drastic step so far in Mr. Xi’s yearslong campaign to root out what he has described as corruption and disloyalty in the military’s senior ranks. It is all the more astonishing because General Zhang seemed to be a confidant of Mr. Xi, who has known him for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This move is unprecedented in the history of the Chinese military and represents the total annihilation of the high command,” Christopher K. Johnson, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst who follows Chinese elite politics, said of the investigation of General Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the two generals effectively out, the Central Military Commission has just two members left: its chairman, Mr. Xi, and General Zhang Shengmin, who has overseen Mr. Xi’s military purges. Mr. Xi has now removed all but one of the six generals he appointed to the commission in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Johnson, the president of China Strategies Group, a consulting firm, said Mr. Xi seemed to have concluded that problems in the military ran so deep that he could not trust the top command to cure itself and must look to a new cohort of rising officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appears to have “decided he must cut very deep generationally to find a group not tainted,” Mr. Johnson said. “The purging of even a childhood friend in Zhang Youxia shows there now are no limits to Xi’s anti-graft zeal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors that the general might be in trouble had spread for days, since official news reports left clues that he and General Liu had been absent from a Communist Party meeting. But General Zhang has disappeared from view before, and a senior official is usually out of sight for months before the party confirms that he is under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed with which General Zhang’s ouster was announced seemed intended to staunch the potential damage for Mr. Xi, said Su Tzu-yun, an expert on the People’s Liberation Army, or P.L.A., at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, a body funded by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This could be a big blow to morale inside the P.L.A.,” Mr. Su said in an interview, referring to the removal of a seemingly invulnerable commander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang and General Liu were also the P.L.A.’s two top commanders for practical operational tasks, and their removal will leave a gap in experience, said Shanshan Mei, a political scientist at RAND, a research organization, who studies China’s armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no one right now at the highest level who has operational experience or who is in charge of training and exercises,” Ms. Mei said. “This is going to cut very deep, and there’s more to come, possibly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang, 75, had seemed to be cordoned off from Mr. Xi’s widening purges. The two men’s fathers, both veterans of Mao Zedong’s revolutionary wars, were personally acquainted, and Mr. Xi had kept General Zhang in office beyond the customary retirement age of about 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Xi’s worries about the trustworthiness of his commanders seemed to finally outweigh whatever attachment he felt to the general, Mr. Su said. “I think this reflects Xi Jinping’s personal sense of insecurity, and that’s a major factor in his purges of the military,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2023, waves of top commanders, officers and executives for arms manufacturers have been removed from office and placed under investigation — or, in some cases, have disappeared from view without explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first purges in that wave focused on China’s Rocket Force, which operates most of its nuclear missiles and many of its conventional ones. Ensuing investigations took down admirals, regional military commanders and members of the Central Military Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the targeted officers had been promoted by Mr. Xi since he took power in 2012, vowing to cleanse the armed forces of endemic graft. But after a decade in charge, he seemed to have concluded that some of his own handpicked protégés had been infected by the military’s corruption, which historically has often involved taking bribes for contracts or promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigations’ toll on the military was visible at a meeting last year of the Communist Party’s Central Committee, a council of top officials. Of the 44 uniformed officers appointed to the committee in 2022, 29 — roughly two-thirds — had been purged or were missing, according to calculations made by Neil Thomas, a researcher on Chinese politics at the Asia Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Xi seems to have calculated that in the longer term, his shake-up of the military will make it less corrupt, more loyal and more effective in pursuing his goals, like putting pressure on Taiwan, the island democracy that rejects China’s claims of sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now, and potentially for years, the disruptions caused by the purges could leave Mr. Xi less confident that his commanders are ready for combat, analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a dilemma,” said Mr. Su, the Taiwan-based analyst. “He wants to first get rid of these so-called corrupt people, but for the P.L.A., if you clear out these high-level officers, that means a whole lot of experience is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang was among the few Chinese commanders with extensive experience in battle. The son of a general, he gained prominence as a frontline officer during China’s last war, a border conflict with Vietnam that began in 1979 and lasted for years. He rose to become head of the General Armaments Department, which is in charge of procuring weapons, and Mr. Xi promoted him to the Central Military Commission in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For Zhang Youxia, having combat experience — and being one of the only left who has any — has to add to his luster, at least to Xi Jinping,” John Culver, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst specializing in the Chinese military, said in an interview before General Zhang’s dismissal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But analysts speculated that General Zhang’s time in the General Armaments Department — which, because it controls arms contracts, became known as a honey pot of corruption — may have planted the seeds of his downfall. Other generals who rose through that department have also been purged, including Li Shangfu, a former defense minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Xi may need years or more to nurture a new crop of — presumably — trustworthy officers, and he must also fill the depleted ranks of the Central Military Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To rebuild these chains of command may take him five years or longer,” Mr. Su said. “The chances of an attack on Taiwan in the short term have been lowered.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-europe-sovereignty-assess-01-jbpg/24int-europe-sovereignty-assess-01-jbpg-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if the Europeans needed another wake-up call about the contempt in which President Trump holds them, his mocking antipathy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, was a good reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Davos presented another lesson to Europe. Standing together on the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty, while warning of severe economic countermeasures, the Europeans achieved an apparent retreat from Mr. Trump over Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sovereignty and the inviolability of borders are fundamental tenets of the European project, built out of the ruins of World War II, when the aggressive imperialism of big powers led to millions of deaths. The lesson was clear: Defending borders collectively is the only way small states are protected from the predations of larger ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Europe finds itself again confronted by big powers with expansionist goals. Russia continues its effort to conquer Ukraine, whose sovereignty it had recognized in numerous treaties. And the United States has been demanding that Denmark, an E.U. and NATO ally, hand over Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But preserving territorial integrity and sovereignty is the red line, expressed both in the European Union, a collective of 27 nations, and in NATO, a military alliance of 32 nations. It can seem quixotic in the current world to be defending international law, the U.N. Charter and the Helsinki Accords, which all insist on the inviolability of borders, but in a sense, that is Europe’s fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That borders can be challenged by force, and the threat of force threatens the core tenets of European security and aspirations since the end of World War II,” said Ian Lesser, the head of the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The war in Ukraine brought it to the fore,” he continued, “but the idea that the United States, the principal guarantor of European security, should be challenging the concept of sovereignty and territorial integrity is a serious concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, argued that the continent has been rediscovering the importance of sovereignty in the face of challenges from the “great powers” of China, Russia and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most of European history since World War II has been about taming sovereignty and pooling it” in multilateral institutions, he said. But the new world is “fundamentally changing the nature of the E.U.,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europeans realize that they cannot defend the old, rules-based order on a global level, “but they can be sure it survives in Europe,” he said. “Thus the importance of Ukraine and Greenland.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Leonard said he hoped that “Europeans will take the lesson of the last few days, that when they stand up for sovereignty and territorial integrity and these rules they can defend them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada won praise for a speech in Davos in which he said that the old international order was dead. “Middle powers” like Canada and Europe, he said, must form new alliances as the great powers abandon postwar international norms and treaties and rely instead on “economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a rupture in the old order, Mr. Carney said: “When the rules no longer protect you, you must protect yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe has been absorbing that lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europeans have resisted Mr. Trump’s demands that Ukraine hand over to Russia territory that Moscow has not conquered. And the Europeans have insisted that even if a peace deal left Russian troops occupying 20 percent of Ukraine, the occupation would never be recognized as permanent, not even in Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Europeans have come up with more money and military aid for Ukraine than the United States, and they have largely picked up the slack after Mr. Trump cut off funding for Ukraine. They recently agreed to another 90 billion euros ($106 billion) in economic and military aid to Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it has been the Europeans who have expressed solidarity with Denmark and Greenland against Mr. Trump’s demands to annex the island on the same principle of territorial integrity, and who seem to have caused him to back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Emmanuel Macron of France spoke for many Europeans at Davos when he said, “Europe has very strong tools now, and we have to use them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Bart De Wever of Belgium was harsher. “So many red lines are being crossed,” he said at the forum. “Being a happy vassal in one thing, being a miserable slave is something else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second Trump presidency has taught Europe that its initial policy of flattering Mr. Trump has been a failure, and that standing up for core principles is vital, said a senior European official, speaking anonymously given the sensitivity of the U.S.-European relationship. In essence, he agreed, Europe has learned that a little flattery is fine, so long as you have a gun in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the case with Denmark and Greenland. For many weeks, European leaders and officials hoped that Mr. Trump would back down over his intention to take Greenland “the easy way” or “the hard way.” Instead he threatened even more punitive tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the European Union scheduled an emergency summit meeting for right after Davos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of Mr. Trump’s threats, the Europeans suspended a pending U.S.-E.U. trade agreement on tariffs that had been criticized as too weak. Instead, they prepared a retaliation of €93 billion ($109 billion) in countertariffs on American goods — the gun in the pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect of those countertariffs upset the markets, said Mr. Leonard of the European Council on Foreign Relations. The effect appeared to have an impact on Mr. Trump and his aides, he said, by showing “that the Europeans were serious and through the markets they pushed Trump to pull back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump, in discussion with Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, then appeared to back down, saying there was an unspecified framework for “a deal” on Greenland and removing his own threatened tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president declared victory, but the real winner in this case were the Europeans, both the European Union and NATO, grasping on to this core principle of no border changes without the consent of the countries involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the E.U. summit meeting early Friday morning, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said the latest tariff threats offered a tactical lesson for dealing with the United States. “Firmness, outreach, preparedness and unity” had been effective, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So going forward we should maintain this very approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller European nations, like the Baltic and Nordic states, are deeply worried about the great powers’ attack on sovereignty, said Jana Puglierin, head of the German office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the end of their business model,” she said. “It’s the very foundation of the European Union and the postwar order, where one country gets one vote, no matter how small.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia, China and the United States are trying to change the entire international order, she said, and Europe is in the middle. All of those countries “are trying to split us,” she said, “because it is easier to deal with us when we are divided.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental question is whether the European Union and NATO can still function in this new, more rapacious world, she said. These institutions “are based on the invulnerability of sovereignty and the principle of consensus, and the challenge now is to the very existence of the organizations that have brought peace and prosperity to Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-uk-trump-01-mfcp/24int-uk-trump-01-mfcp-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain has learned, after a roller coaster year that ended in a tense confrontation over Greenland, that it cannot change President Trump. The more tantalizing question is whether Mr. Trump has changed Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s charm offensive toward the president did not spare Britain a fusillade of new tariff threats and stinging social media posts over the British government’s opposition to Mr. Trump’s designs on Greenland. Mr. Starmer might argue that Mr. Trump’s subsequent climb-down validated his emollient approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Mr. Trump also turned against a deal made by Mr. Starmer, which he had previously endorsed, to relinquish a chain of strategically sensitive islands in the Indian Ocean to Mauritius. He disparaged it as an “act of GREAT STUPIDITY,” handing Mr. Starmer’s opponents a cudgel with which to beat him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, parroted Mr. Trump’s criticism. “This is surrendering British territory, with a strategic military base on it, for no reason whatsoever,” she said to Sky News, referring to the air base on an island in the chain, Diego Garcia, which is jointly operated by Britain and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind that Britain began negotiating the return of the chain, the Chagos Islands, under a government led by Ms. Badenoch’s Conservatives. Or that Mr. Trump’s pique appeared to be caused less by the loss of the islands than by Mr. Starmer’s refusal to go along with an American takeover of Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a telling example of how Mr. Trump has commandeered the political debate in Britain, often shifting it in his direction. On topics as diverse as immigration, climate change, geopolitics and social justice, Mr. Trump has moved Britain’s “Overton window,” the term used to refer to the range of ideas that are considered acceptable to mainstream society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no doubt that Trump has shifted the center of gravity in British politics,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. “Politicians on the right — and not just those who belong to the populist, radical right but to a supposedly mainstream party like the Conservatives — are prepared to propose policies and use language that hitherto would have been seen as beyond the pale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just as importantly, like Trump, they’ve gotten away with it,” he added, “and, as a result, are tempted to go further and further — all of which has led to both a coarsening and a polarization of debate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Mr. Starmer, a center-left politician known for his tempered style, has strayed into the divisive rhetoric of Mr. Trump. Last year, speaking about immigration, he warned that Britain risked becoming an “island of strangers” if it did not regain control of its borders. (Mr. Starmer later expressed regret for those words, which drew invidious comparisons to an infamous speech about immigration by a Conservative Party lawmaker, Enoch Powell, in 1968.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under pressure from a right-wing anti-immigration party, Reform U.K., which is in turn partly inspired by Mr. Trump, the Labour government has adopted strikingly tougher policies toward asylum seekers. Mr. Starmer has posted photographs and footage on social media of young men being rounded up, fingerprinted and interviewed by the authorities, and the government has boasted about the removal of almost 50,000 people since it came to power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump’s influence is felt in a backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Blue Labour, an activist group that promotes culturally conservative values within the Labour Party, has called on the government to legislate against such policies in hiring, in part to fend off the threat from Reform. The Guardian newspaper reported in October that many British companies were changing their policies in response to attacks on “woke” policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, too, there is Mr. Trump’s insurgency against the establishment, which has its echoes in Britain. This month, a former senior adviser to Mr. Starmer, Paul Ovenden, roiled political waters with a column in The Times of London, in which he condemned unelected civil servants who, he claimed, waste their time on “political folderol” rather than on issues that ordinary citizens care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The supremacy of the Stakeholder State,” Mr. Ovenden called it, in words that bear more than a passing resemblance to the “deep state” vilified by allies of Mr. Trump, like Stephen K. Bannon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the changes in British policies, like the cuts to foreign aid, are driven by fiscal constraints. Others, like the pressure to water down climate change targets, are prompted by fears that they could hamper long-term economic growth. Yet they dovetail with Mr. Trump’s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain has continued to embrace renewable energy even as Mr. Trump has ridiculed the wind turbines that dot the North Sea. “One thing I’ve noticed,” Mr. Trump said in Davos, Switzerland, this past week, “is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump’s influence is not limited to Britain. Timothy Garton Ash, an author and historian at Oxford University, argued that the president had had a bigger effect on Germany and Poland. Germany has embarked on a landmark rearmament program to compensate for Mr. Trump’s disengagement from Europe. In Poland, the right-wing populist Law and Justice Party benefited from Mr. Trump’s endorsement in last year’s presidential elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where you can see his influence in Britain is on the right-wing conversation,” Mr. Garton Ash said. “It has blurred the boundaries between liberal conservatives and the anti-liberal right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Starmer fended off Ms. Badenoch’s attacks on the Chagos Islands deal, one could see the risks in Mr. Trump’s influence. The prime minister told Parliament, in an uncharacteristic break with Mr. Trump, that the president’s criticism was not about the islands but was a calculated effort to put pressure on Britain to acquiesce in his attempted conquest of Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By jumping on Mr. Trump’s remarks, Mr. Starmer said, Ms. Badenoch was “undermining our position, Britain’s position, on Greenland.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Starmer’s steely tone suggested that there were limits to his solicitous treatment of Mr. Trump. He said he would not be cowed, either by the president’s reversal on the Chagos deal or by threats of additional tariffs. Mr. Trump dropped the tariff threat after negotiating the outlines of a deal on Greenland with NATO. But on Friday, the Conservatives forced the government to delay a debate in Parliament on legislation enshrining the Chagos deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diplomats have credited Mr. Starmer’s softly-softly approach to the president with reducing the damage of tariffs — the Trump administration signed a first-in-the-world trade deal with Britain — and with keeping Mr. Trump more engaged in the war in Ukraine than he might otherwise have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, said Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to Washington, “It did not moderate Trump’s demands for Greenland, while his ill-informed outburst on Diego Garcia was plain nasty. So Starmer has had to call him out publicly on important issues of principle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most vivid example of this came on Friday when Mr. Starmer rebuked Mr. Trump for saying that European troops had “stayed a little off the front lines” during the Afghanistan war. Mr. Starmer said his remarks were “insulting and frankly appalling” to Britain, which lost 457 soldiers in two decades of fighting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The challenge,” Mr. Westmacott said, “is to do that without provoking even worse reactions from the notoriously thin-skinned president.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-venezuela-repression-blwp/24int-venezuela-repression-blwp-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boys were there for a water balloon fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an annual tradition to start Carnival celebrations in Barcelona, a working-class coastal city in Venezuela’s east. But only two days after the capture of the nation’s president, Nicolás Maduro, all of their shouting and laughing was not sitting well with the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local police officers and National Guard soldiers arrived in force and, according to two of the boys and the relatives of four others, fired shots. The boys and young men — aged 13 to 25 — scattered, but the police arrested 25 of them. Two days later, state prosecutors filed charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their crime? Treason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘I’m going to screw you all over,’” one of the boys, 17, recalled a police officer telling him after his arrest, using an expletive. “‘You all support Donald Trump.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reporter and photographer from The New York Times this past week visited the neighborhood where most of the detainees live and interviewed two of the boys and seven of their family members. Many of them, as well as other Venezuelans across the country, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal from the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those interviews revealed that, under the Venezuelan interim government backed by the Trump administration, citizen surveillance and repression are alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has praised Venezuela’s interim leadership as highly cooperative, particularly in opening up U.S. access to the country’s oil. Those leaders, who are the same people who helped direct the authoritarian Maduro regime, have also drawn positive headlines for their release of nearly 150 political prisoners, or about a sixth of the nation’s estimated total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, they have quietly added to those ranks, detaining and jailing people suspected of opposing the government, as part of a nationwide campaign to stamp out dissent since the United States captured Mr. Maduro three weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security forces have set up checkpoints on highways, searched citizens’ cellphones, extorted people whose phones contained criticism of the government and arrested dozens of others suspected of celebrating Mr. Maduro’s capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can be detained simply for traveling the streets. Not in the sense that they put you in prison, but that they stop you and demand your phone,” said Andrés Azpúrua, an internet-freedom activist in Venezuela who tracks government repression. “This has been happening for a long time. But not at these scales.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that many Venezuelans, while maybe more hopeful since Mr. Maduro’s capture, remain terrified of saying so out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know what’s going on, but no one can express an opinion,” said a 49-year-old driver, who lives in the same state as the detained boys. “We want to shout, to celebrate, but we can’t. I want to, but I don’t know where.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the interview, the man frequently spoke in a whisper, worried his neighbor might overhear and report him to the police. He added that he leaves his phone behind every time he goes out, fearful the police will search it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Venezuelan government did not respond to a request for comment. Diosdado Cabello, the nation’s powerful interior minister who runs much of the state’s intelligence and security forces, acknowledged last week that some officers had extorted citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have told the police officers that for anyone who wants to be a policeman, extortion has no place here,” he said, according to a post from his political party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuelans’ anxiety is driven by years of harsh, systematic repression by the Maduro government. A complex mix of security forces — from military soldiers and police officers, to intelligence agents and masked, armed militias — spied on, threatened, extorted and arrested people perceived to be a potential threat to the regime. Targets included opposition politicians, activists, academics, journalists and even regular people who had simply criticized the government in private conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two weeks, Venezuelan authorities have slowly been releasing about a sixth of the nation’s nearly 900 political prisoners, according to human-rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House has taken credit. Mr. Trump has also consistently praised Venezuela’s interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, who was Mr. Maduro’s vice president, while undercutting her rival, María Corina Machado, the exiled opposition leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She’s doing a very good job. We have a very good relationship,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Rodríguez this past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Ms. Rodríguez has been overseeing a crackdown at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day Mr. Maduro was captured, Ms. Rodríguez announced a state of emergency in Venezuela that, in effect, gave the government the authority to detain anyone suspected of supporting the U.S. attack. She claimed Mr. Maduro had signed the measure — supposedly as he rushed for safety after the attacks began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Venezuelan authorities have arrested at least 31 people and accused them of supporting the U.S. attack, according to an analysis of local news reports. Several were detained for videos they posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most striking case was the arrest of the 25 boys and young men in Barcelona, a midsize city about five hours east of Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the recent visit by The Times journalists, the city was on edge. Armed officers at four checkpoints interrogated and sometimes searched passers-by. At sundown in the dense neighborhood where the detainees lived, about a dozen police officers on motorcycles patrolled the streets. The police presence had increased since Mr. Maduro’s capture, according to residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble for the neighborhood youth began on Jan. 5. Boys and young men filled water balloons at the bank of the Neverí River and then, according to videos, chased one another around a vacant lot, tossing the balloons and laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the authorities showed up, the young people thought the arrests would be only temporary to teach them a lesson about causing commotion in the street. But when the police began mentioning Mr. Trump and Mr. Maduro, and then transferred the group to a larger jail, it became clear the situation was more serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all started crying and asking why, saying that they weren’t criminals, that they were just children playing for Carnival,” said the mother of two detainees, describing the scene of distressed parents outside the jailhouse. “Because the country was in trouble,” the police told her, she added. “And if we knew how the country was, why did we let our children be in the street?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen minors in the group were arraigned on several charges including “treason to the homeland,” according to a court document viewed by The Times. Families of the 10 detainees over 18 said they had also been charged with treason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Families began distributing videos about the teenagers on social media, denouncing their detention. The videos gained traction in the local community, and a week after they were jailed, the authorities released the 15 minors under the condition that they remain in Venezuela and return to court once a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the 10 adult detainees remain imprisoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t eaten for days,” said Scarlett Ruiz, 24, the sister of one detainee who is 19 and had been preparing to enter college this year. She said the family has been taking him meals and attending court hearings for the past two weeks, watching his condition deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My brother isn’t sleeping. He has bags under his eyes,” Ms. Ruiz said. “They tell them things like, ‘You’re not going to get out of here.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;María Reyes said she worried about her 21-year-old son in detention because he regularly suffered from epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Karen García, the mother of an 18-year-old detainee, said she had not seen her son since Jan. 5. She is confused how her family got wrapped up in the situation. “We’re not political people at all, nor are we interested in giving opinions on that,” she said. “The only thing we want is freedom for our boys.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-iran-irgc01a-photo-gkhw/24int-iran-irgc01a-photo-gkhw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks after Israeli warplanes pounded Iran’s capital last June, the country’s top generals stood in their socks at the entrance of a mosque in northern Tehran, mourning the men who had been killed in the strikes — leaders who they would now replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strikes had caused the greatest single blow to Iran’s military in decades, wiping out the top leadership of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the feared praetorian guard to the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the question was how would this new generation of leaders, catapulted to the top, would guide the country through a singularly challenging period, including growing economic stress, the prospect of new international sanctions and regular threats of yet more military strikes from President Trump and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer came in recent weeks when those new leaders responded to nationwide protests with breathtaking brutality, opening fire on unarmed protesters and massacring thousands of people. At least one Iranian human rights group based in the United States said it had confirmed 5,002 deaths, including 207 members of the security forces, during the protests from Dec. 28 to mid-January. In their first official toll on Wednesday, the Iranian authorities said that 3,117 people had died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, the bloody crackdown affirmed the unity of Iran’s ruling system — centered on the ayatollah and the Revolutionary Guards, estimated to number about 150,000 — and its willingness to take ruthless action to ensure its survival. But Iran experts said the bloody response was also a sign of the system’s growing weakness, exposing the limits of Ayatollah Khamenei’s 37-year rule as he wrestles with surging domestic unrest and intense foreign pressure at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Mr. Trump said that an American “armada” was heading toward Iran, but that he hoped he would not have to use it. He again warned the Iranian government against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That combination of factors put the ruling system under immense strain, said Afshon Ostovar, an Iran expert at the Naval Postgraduate School in California and the author of “Vanguard of the Imam,” a history of the Revolutionary Guards. “Right off the bat, they saw the protests as an existential threat,” he said. “They turned to live fire really quickly because their weakness was acute, and they knew it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the ayatollah’s legitimacy under open challenge, the Revolutionary Guards are emerging as the core of the system. “You have this aging theocrat whose days are numbered,” Mr. Ostovar said. “And you have security forces that are taking an increasingly aggressive response to any threat to the regime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upheaval has renewed comparisons between the Islamic Republic and the Soviet Union in the 1980s, before it collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran has seldom faced a greater array of challenges. Its network of regional proxies, including Hezbollah and Hamas, is in tatters. Its contentious nuclear program, estimated to cost tens of billions of dollars, failed to bring deterrence. Supplies of water and electricity are running low. Edicts forcing Iranian women to wear head scarves, a symbolic totem of the ayatollah’s conservative rule, are being openly flouted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The regime is ideologically bankrupt, economically at a dead end, and unable to rescue itself,” said Ali Vaez, the Iran project director for the International Crisis Group, a research body. “But it still has the will, and a fearsome capacity for repression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ayatollah, who promised to strengthen the Islamic Republic after he came to power in 1989, has led the country into this predicament, critics say. His intransigence, rooted in resistance to the United States and Israel, but also in opposition to change at home, was once a pillar of his iron rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that approach is seen by some as a mark of vulnerability, even by some of his own supporters, and analysts say his authority is at its lowest in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American and Israeli airstrikes in June initially provoked a nationalist surge inside Iran, as people across the political spectrum united against foreign aggression. “All these stupid attacks by the Zionists have brought Iranians together,” Abdulkarim Alizadeh, a retired commander with the Revolutionary Guards, said last summer as he left the mosque in northern Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran’s enemies had “miscalculated” if they hoped the attacks would provoke a popular uprising, Kamal Kharazi, a senior adviser to the supreme leader, told The New York Times in July. “On the contrary,” he said, “the war led to national unity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are prepared for all scenarios,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But defiance soon gave way to economic reality as the United Nations imposed new sanctions on Iran, causing the national currency to collapse. Protests on Dec. 28 in Tehran’s the main bazaars — whose merchants played a central role in the 1979 revolution — quickly spread across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the balance of power in Iran has been quietly shifting from Ayatollah Khamenei, 86, to the Revolutionary Guards. They are not only a security behemoth. They control a media empire, large parts of the economy, oil exports, seaports, an intelligence agency and an air force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have everything that it takes to assume power,” Mr. Vaez said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One scenario is that a figure favored by the Revolutionary Guards would seize power after the death of Ayatollah Khamenei, transforming Iran from a theocracy to a military-dominated country like Pakistan or Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another scenario is that a faction of the Revolutionary Guards, fearful of American-backed regime change, could move against him first. “While a military coup was unthinkable a few years ago,” Mr. Ostovar said, “it’s becoming increasingly likely now because of all the pressures building on the regime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is further complicated by the generational divide inside the Revolutionary Guards, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the older generation came of age during the war with Iraq in the 1980s, a time of deprivation and hardship, younger officers rose through the ranks at a time of Iranian expansion, as its influence spread through Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dismayed by the loss of that foreign network over the past few years, as well as by the severe damage to Iran’s nuclear program caused by the 12-day war in June, a more aggressive and assertive faction has emerged among younger members of the Revolutionary Guards, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while an older group of Revolutionary Guards has gotten rich — with children in elite private schools, homes in foreign countries and luxury cars — the younger generation has yet to taste much of that wealth, and wants to protect what it sees as its rightful reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They know that if the regime goes, they will lose their meal ticket — and be first in line for retribution,” Mr. Ostovar said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Iran goes from here is hard to know, but its future path has drawn comparisons with countries like North Korea, Turkey, Egypt and Russia. Still, predictions are fraught: In recent weeks, the internet has been restricted and a curtain of fear has fallen over the country, making information especially scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran’s government has survived at least four earlier waves of protest, many of which also stirred speculation of regime change, while the ayatollah has defied rumors that he was dying of cancer or was in poor health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most analysts agree that, this time, the pressure on Ayatollah Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards is likely to only increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is not a sustainable situation where you wait for an elderly leader to die to put things back in order,” said Mr. Vaez, drawing comparisons with the last years of Mao Zedong in China, or Leonid I. Brezhnev in the Soviet Union. In Iran, “the problem is the country doesn’t have the time to wait him out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-ukraine-talks-lmgj/24int-ukraine-talks-lmgj-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rare three-way talks among Russian, Ukrainian and American officials entered their second day on Saturday in the United Arab Emirates, as President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that he expected “at least some answers” from Russia on the current draft of a plan to end the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peace plan originated last fall as a proposal negotiated between the Trump administration and Russia, but it has since been revised several times, with input from Ukraine, the United States, European nations and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zelensky argued in recent days that it was time for Russia to provide answers on the peace plan as it now stands, even as Moscow has shown little appetite to stop its attacks on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peace plan’s 20 points cover security, postwar reconstruction, exchanges of prisoners and other matters tied to the conflict, which started nearly four years ago with Russia’s full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking late Friday after the first day of talks, Mr. Zelensky said in a video address to Ukrainians that he was regularly in touch with the country’s negotiators in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, and that they “should already have at least some answers” on Moscow’s position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Zelensky said it was “still too early to draw conclusions” on whether Russia would negotiate in good faith. The talks are expected to wrap up on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is necessary that not only Ukraine has the desire to end this war and achieve full security, but that a similar desire somehow emerges in Russia as well,” Mr. Zelensky said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite some progress in recent months of peace negotiations, Ukraine and Russia are still at odds over key sticking points tied to security and territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, Ukraine fleshed out proposals for postwar security guarantees with both the United States and Europe, with some European countries vowing that they would commit troops to dissuade Russia from invading again. But Moscow has rejected any deployment of troops from NATO member states on Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Ukrainian authorities have refused Russia’s request to control all of the Donetsk region, a former industrial and coal-mining powerhouse in eastern Ukraine that the war has left mostly in ruins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators have discussed what Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s envoy for peace talks, has called various “iterations” of compromises. Suggestions have included putting neutral forces as peacekeepers in part of the Donetsk region or forming a demilitarized zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Russia has rejected any settlement on territory that departs from what Russian officials have characterized as an agreement reached between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin at a summit in Alaska last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After those talks, neither leader publicly laid out a detailed plan for dividing Ukrainian territory, although Mr. Trump told European leaders at the time that he supported a plan to end the war by ceding unconquered territory to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Mr. Zelensky said the talks in the United Arab Emirates would focus on control of territory in eastern Ukraine. Any compromise for Ukraine would be bitter after more than a decade of bloodshed defending the region, beginning with a first Russian military incursion in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zelensky told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday that “we are at the moment, if all the sides will work a lot, we will end this war.” But he also suggested that Russia might “play games” that would derail talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria’s defense ministry said on Saturday that it would extend a cease-fire across all military operations for 15 days, hours after a weeklong truce with a Kurdish-led militia in the country’s northeast expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry said in a statement on social media that the extension was in support of an operation led by the United States to transfer detainees from the Islamic State group held in Syria to Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syrian government troops have in recent weeks taken control of large areas of territory held by Kurds in eastern and northern Syria, including strategic assets like oil fields and dams, after intense clashes with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Syrian armed forces took over parts of the northeast, the United States began relocating detainees from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, amid concerns that thousands of former fighters and their relatives could break out of detention in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense ministry’s statement on Saturday made no explicit reference to the government’s conflict with the S.D.F., though the group said in a subsequent post on social media that an agreement had been reached through international mediation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Syrian government and the Kurds agreed last Sunday to an immediate cease-fire that called for the full integration of Kurdish troops into the national army, a longstanding demand of the Syrian government, as well as the handing over of administrative control of much of the northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Syrian state news agency SANA reported on Tuesday that the government had given the S.D.F. four days to submit a detailed plan for the integration of Hasakah Province, which was the only province left under the militia’s authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether a plan had been submitted, and a spokesman for the group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts widely saw the truce deal as a capitulation, because the S.D.F. lost almost all of the concessions the Syrian government had offered in earlier negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SANA cited an unnamed government source on Saturday night as saying that the cease-fire had ended, and that it was weighing its next steps. And Syria’s foreign ministry had dismissed reports circulating on social media that the deadline would be extended, SANA said, citing a ministry official, Mohammad Taha al-Ahmad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All options remain on the table, alongside calm and dialogue, to enforce the law, preserve Syria’s unity and safeguard the rights of the Syrian people,” Mr. al-Ahmad said, according to SANA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S.D.F. had accused the government on social media of deploying troops in breach of the cease-fire, saying it was an effort to “undermine de-escalation and steer the situation toward war instead of political solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s recent advances have strengthened President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s grip on Syria, more than a year after his rebel forces overthrew the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad, whose family had ruled the country for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. al-Sharaa has sought to bring Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious communities under centralized rule with himself at the helm in the capital, Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has also pledged that all of Syria’s minority communities will be protected under his government and, this month, signed a decree affirming Kurdish rights, including calls to restore Syrian citizenship to Kurds stripped of it after a 1962 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S.D.F., which has long positioned itself as the defender of Syrian Kurds and administered a de facto state in northeastern Syria, has posed the most formidable challenge to Mr. al-Sharaa’s effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kurdish-led militia has resisted full integration into the government’s army, seeking autonomy over its territories and security in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet those Kurdish forces have also long been key partners of the United States, assisting in the fight against the Islamic State guarding American bases and managing detention camps and prisons that housed thousands of jihadists and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership appeared to come undone this week, after the U.S. special envoy to Syria, Thomas J. Barrack, said that Washington no longer viewed Kurdish-led forces as its main partner in the fight against the Islamic State. Mr. Barrack said he believed that the Syrian government was now ready to take on those responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That apparent policy shift reflected Washington’s increasing confidence in Mr. al-Sharaa, who maintains a close relationship with President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the Kurdish militia fighters, “There’s a profound sense of abandonment and fear, layered with exhaustion,” said Nanar Hawach, a senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, which focuses on conflict prevention. “For them, individual integration into the Syrian army isn’t a bureaucratic detail. It is the end of the project they have fought for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cease-fire remained fragile and, this week, fighting broke out around two prisons in northeast Syria that housed ISIS members, highlighting the vulnerability of the agreement and raising fears that some may escape during the handover process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for American military operations in the Middle East, said that U.S. forces had already relocated 150 Islamic State fighters from a detention center in northeastern Syria to an undisclosed “secure location” in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military added that as many as 7,000 ISIS detainees currently held in Syria could eventually be transferred to facilities managed by Iraqi authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the cease-fire, the S.D.F. agreed to transfer control of the northern province of Raqqa and the eastern province of Deir al-Zour to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the cease-fire was extended, the United Nations warned of a looming humanitarian crisis in some Kurdish-held cities in Syria, citing disruptions to electricity and water amid bitter winter conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary general, said on Friday that all roads into Kobani, a Kurdish stronghold in northern Syria, were closed, and that disruptions to electricity, water and internet were limiting access to basic services. Food and essential supplies are at risk of shortages, he said, and while health facilities remain open, medicine remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.N. was working with its partners and local authorities to conduct additional assessments and secure access, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, even as Mr. al-Sharaa makes territorial gains, he faces a crucial test, Mr. Hawach said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Al-Sharaa has an opportunity here,” he said. “If he can now demonstrate that integration means genuine inclusion, it would be the strongest signal yet that Syria’s new order is different from what came before.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/24int-canada-trump-tkcv/24int-canada-trump-tkcv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump on Saturday threatened Canada with steep tariffs if it “makes a deal with China” and insulted Prime Minister Mark Carney, his latest swing at the country since Mr. Carney pushed back against his policies in a highly publicized speech in Davos, Switzerland, this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,” Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social. He referred to Mr. Carney as “Governor Carney,” a reference to Mr. Trump’s repeated insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no indication that Canada and China are in discussions about a broad trade agreement. Mr. Trump may have been reacting to Mr. Carney’s state visit to China last week, during which he agreed to lower tariffs on some Chinese electric vehicles in exchange for China doing the same for some Canadian agricultural products. The closely watched visit was billed as a crucial reset in the two countries’ relationship, but the trade agreement itself was modest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada gave Jamieson Greer, the U.S. Trade Representative, a detailed preview of the agreement with China before it was signed, a senior Canadian official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to divulge details about communication between the two administrations. Mr. Trump appeared to praise Mr. Carney after the deal was announced. (“Good for him,” he said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he soured on the prime minister after Mr. Carney’s Davos speech, in which Mr. Carney declared that the U.S.-led world order had been ruptured and called on “middle powers” like Canada to band together to survive a new and perilous era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without mentioning Mr. Trump or the United States by name, Mr. Carney pointedly called out the use of tariffs as coercion. “More recently, great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,” Mr. Carney said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speech did not go down well with Mr. Trump, who responded in his own address the next day at Davos, saying that Canada “lives because of the United States.” Mr. Trump also rescinded an invitation to Mr. Carney to join his “Board of Peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Carney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Trump’s post on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mr. Trump routinely fails to make good on his tariff threats, calling Mr. Carney “governor” could be a bad sign for the two countries’ relationship. After returning to the White House last year, Mr. Trump routinely applied the title to Mr. Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, as part of his rhetoric about the United States annexing Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our economics reporters — based in New York, London, Brussels, Berlin, Hong Kong and Seoul — are digging into every aspect of the tariffs causing global turmoil. They are joined by dozens of reporters writing about the effects on everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Carney had been much more respectful, at least until the Davos gathering. The leaders met several times last year, twice in the White House, and Mr. Trump expressed admiration for Mr. Carney’s electoral victory last spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, their warm words have not materialized into an improved trade relationship. Though the United States has a three-way trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has imposed tariffs on certain exports from both countries, which in Canada’s case have hurt its steel, aluminum, automobile and lumber industries. A review of the three-way trade deal is due this year, and its renewal is far from certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has maintained that the United States does not need anything from Canada, even as it gets most of its imported oil from its northern neighbor and their economies continue to be closely integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest flashpoint bodes ill for Canada’s efforts to stabilize its relationship with the Trump administration, just as Mr. Carney looks for new allies and trading partners to lessen his country’s overwhelming dependence on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Mr. Carney is a former governor of the central banks of both Canada and Britain, he is new to elected office, and he has staked his leadership of Canada on a strategy of diversifying from the United States and streamlining trade within Canada itself. He has also committed billions to making Canada less dependent on the United States for its defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his Davos speech, Mr. Carney indicated that he had given up hopes of a return to the way things had been before Mr. Trump’s second term. “The old order is not coming back. We should not mourn it,” he said. “Nostalgia is not a strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
