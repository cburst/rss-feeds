&lt;p&gt;David Webb, an activist investor who sparred with the rich and powerful of Hong Kong in campaigns for greater financial transparency and regulation, died on Tuesday in a hospital there. He was 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause was metastatic prostate cancer, his wife, Karen Webb, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Webb, who moved to Hong Kong from his native Britain more than three decades ago, battled with financial regulators in that Asian financial hub on behalf of minority shareholders, took on the tycoons who dominated Hong Kong’s economy, and exposed shady business dealings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His most enduring creation is a free public online database that meticulously catalogs the city’s companies and their directors. Webb-site, as he named it, has shed light on the inner workings of Hong Kong’s corporate world and has become an invaluable resource for corporate investigators and journalists alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Webb’s biggest exposé on his platform was a report that documented previously unknown connections between a network of 50 companies that he called the “Enigma Network.” The report, published in 2017, caused the companies’ shares to plummet and prompted investigations by government watchdogs into share price manipulation by the companies’ owners that hurt small investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Michael Webb was born in London on Aug. 29, 1965, and adopted as an infant by a couple living in the city of Leicester, in England’s East Midlands. His mother was a dispensing optician and his father an economist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How The Times decides who gets an obituary. There is no formula, scoring system or checklist in determining the news value of a life. We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, David lived with his family in Bangkok for two years before returning to Britain. At age 16, he designed games and wrote books about coding in the early days of personal computing and sold them for profit, investing his royalties in the stock market. After graduating from Exeter College at Oxford University with a mathematics degree in 1983, he worked for three investment banks in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Webb arrived in Hong Kong from London in 1991 six years before the British colonial government handed over control of the city to the People’s Republic of China. He had lived there ever since. By his account, he came to see great potential in the smaller and lesser-known companies listed on the city’s stock exchange and began digging into their financials to uncover gems that others had overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the age of 32, he had earned enough to leave his job. He divided his time between managing his own investments and activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He launched Webb-site in 1998, the same year Google launched its search engine. Mr. Webb’s database, which retained the plain, text-heavy style of early web pages, is an extensive trove of analytical reports, financial news and company disclosures. In clear and cutting language, he called out bad corporate actors and the flaws in the financial system that allowed them to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when Mr. Webb tried to change the system from within. In 2003, he won a seat on the board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange but resigned a few years later, accusing it of withholding information from the board and bowing to political concerns. He realized that he would “be better off on the outside rocking the boat,” he said in an interview with The New York Times in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While finance was his main focus, Mr. Webb saw Hong Kong’s economic prospects as inseparable from its political system. In 2014, he gave a speech before thousands of protesters who were calling for a more democratic way of electing the city’s leader, saying that a popular mandate would make Hong Kong more stable and prosperous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry about the small economic impact of these protests,” he said, according to a transcript of the speech on his website. “Think about the large economic benefits of a more dynamic economy, ending collusion between the government and the tycoons who currently elect” the city’s leader, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, massive antigovernment protests rocked the city, and Beijing responded with a security crackdown. In the following years, Hong Kong’s government limited the public’s access to corporate information, arguing that company directors’ identifying details should be obscured to address concerns about privacy. (Mr. Webb had lobbied against the move, succeeding for a time, but the rules were ultimately changed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer in 2020. Five years later, after being told he had months to live, he announced that he was trying to find someone to operate Webb-site. But by then, maintaining a repository that examines companies and the powerful people behind them carried political and legal risks, and Mr. Webb found no one willing to take it over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We may have reached, in Hong Kong, what I would call peak authoritarianism,” Mr. Webb said in May in a rare public talk, at the Foreign Correspondents Club. “Things, I hope, will get a lot better after my time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, his mother, a sister and a brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To preserve his legacy, Mr. Webb provided backup copies of many of his reports to the Internet Archive and in recent months received accolades from all corners of the corporate world. In June, he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire for raising standards of corporate and economic governance in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t want to just, at the end of my life, have the epitaph: He made a lot of money,” Mr. Webb said in the interview with The Times. “Lots of investors have done that. It’s much better to feel that you’ve accomplished something in the policy areas, made the place you live in a better place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/14/multimedia/14int-Canada-Quebec-qgfc/14int-Canada-Quebec-qgfc-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deeply unpopular premier of Quebec, François Legault, said on Wednesday that he would resign after seven years in power, acknowledging after months of desperate attempts to revive his standing in the polls that “Quebecers want change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement — only weeks after Mr. Legault’s pledge to run for a third term — could upend the political dynamics in Canada’s French-speaking province ahead of a general election likely to be held next fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Legault said that he would step down after his party, Coalition Avenir Québec, a pro-business, center-right party, selects a new leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could now mount a more solid challenge to the party currently leading in the polls, the pro-separatist Parti Québécois, which has vowed to hold a referendum on independence from the rest of Canada. Mr. Legault’s party opposes separatist efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For the good of my party and especially for the good of Quebec, I’m announcing that I will resign as premier,” Mr. Legault said during an 18-minute news conference in Quebec City, declining to take follow-up questions from journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By resigning, Mr. Legault, 68, said he hoped that the next election would be decided “not on a simple desire for change” but on the great challenges facing Quebec, including restructuring its economy and stopping the decline of the French language, especially in Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Legault rose to become one of Canada’s most popular premiers during the pandemic thanks to his reassuring, avuncular presence. He was overwhelmingly elected to a second four-year term in October 2022. But in the past three years, the failure to establish a high-profile battery plant, the troubled digitizing of some government services and other missteps sank Mr. Legault and his party in the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Legault, according to several polls, became Canada’s most unpopular premier, he grasped unsuccessfully at policies designed to give him a rapid boost. In September, Mr. Legault compared himself to the fictional boxer Rocky Balboa, posing with his fists clenched, and said that he would triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of his attempts, including recent hardball negotiations over pay with the province’s medical doctors, backfired and left him little leeway in launching a campaign for a third term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A businessman who co-founded a budget airline before entering politics, Mr. Legault offered a third way in Quebec politics, which was historically dominated by the pro-separatist, social democratic Parti Québécois and the pro-federalist, pro-business Quebec Liberal Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Legault’s party was staunchly pro-business and, though opposing independence, tapped into a French Québécois nationalism that appealed to the province’s majority, especially among older and rural voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Mr. Legault, Quebec banned public employees from wearing religious symbols in the workplace, saying that the law was necessary to safeguard the province’s secular identity. Critics said the move was meant to score political points by targeting Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Legault’s government also passed legislation further strengthening the use of French in business, education and government — at the expense, critics said, of English speakers. Mr. Legault and his allies have said that the use of French has declined in the province, especially in its biggest city, Montreal. But critics say that Mr. Legault’s assertion relies on a narrow, ethnic-based definition of French speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quebec’s next general election must be held by Oct. 5, but could be held earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Parti Québécois enjoys a strong lead in the polls. Its charismatic leader, Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, has said that if his party takes power, he will hold a referendum on independence during his first term. The pro-federalist Liberal Party is languishing in the polls after revelations of campaign misdeeds recently forced its newly elected leader to step down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls show that the majority of Quebecers do not back independence. Quebec has grown more international since two failed attempts at secession, in 1995 and 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separatist movement is also brewing in Alberta, the oil-rich province in western Canada, where separatists and others believe that the federal government wields too much power over them.&lt;/p&gt;

President Trump has said that “help is on the way” for Iranian protesters. Amid reports that thousands of the protesters have been killed, our national security correspondent David E. Sanger describes what some of Mr. Trump’s options might be.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15int-venezuela-american-prisoner-zwfg/15int-venezuela-american-prisoner-zwfg-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When several Americans held in Venezuela’s notoriously harsh prison system were released on Tuesday, among them was a traveler whose relatives had lost track of him in early December, leaving them agonizing over whether he was alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man, James Luckey-Lange, is a 28-year-old New Yorker and the son of the late musician Diane Luckey, who was known as Q Lazzarus and sang the soaring 1988 hit single “Goodbye Horses.” His release was confirmed by his aunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Luckey-Lange had been on an extended trip through South America after the death of his parents, his aunt Abbie Luckey said, when he crossed into Venezuela and was detained. It was unclear if Mr. Luckey-Lange had a visa to enter Venezuela, as the country’s law requires of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Luckey, Mr. Luckey-Lange’s next of kin, said in a phone interview on Wednesday that she could finally relax, knowing her nephew was free and in good health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a great release,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of Mr. Luckey-Lange and several other U.S. citizens represented a major step in the liberalization of Venezuela’s interim government. They were the first known Americans freed from the nation’s prisons since the U.S. military attacked the country and seized President Nicolás Maduro in an audacious nighttime raid in the heart of the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We welcome the release of detained Americans in Venezuela,” the State Department said in a statement on Tuesday night. “This is an important step in the right direction by the interim authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Mr. Maduro, scores of political prisoners were often held for long periods and the international citizens among them were sometimes used by the government as bargaining chips in negotiations. Many were held on vague charges like terrorism or espionage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela’s detention of Americans has long been a focus for President Trump. By the summer, more than two dozen U.S. citizens or permanent residents had been released amid his administration’s negotiations with the government, including some in a deal made by Richard Grenell, one of Mr. Trump’s special envoys, days after Mr. Trump’s inauguration in his second term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s decision to suspend those talks as the administration recently ramped up its pressure campaign on Mr. Maduro appeared to end such prisoner releases. The number of detained Americans in Venezuela began to rise again in the fall, according to a U.S. official who spoke to The New York Times in December on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Luckey-Lange’s travels coincided with that shift. He wrote in his blog in December that he was doing research on gold mining in the Amazon region of Guyana, which borders Venezuela. On Dec. 7, he wrote to a friend that he was at an unspecified location in Venezuela, and he last spoke to his family the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he was heading to the capital, Caracas, where he was planning to catch a flight on Dec. 12 that would eventually take him home to New York. His family reported him missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mr. Luckey-Lange set out traveling in 2022, his mother had just died. The song she was best known for, “Goodbye Horses,” was featured in the 1991 film “Silence of the Lambs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His father, Robert Lange, died last year. Eva Aridjis Fuentes, a filmmaker who worked with Mr. Luckey-Lange for a documentary about Q Lazzarus, said he set out traveling to find his own path. “He has had so much loss,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela has about 800 to 900 political prisoners, rights groups estimate. Since last week, some prisoners from Italy and Spain have been among those released, according to Venezuela’s leading human rights organization, Foro Penal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country’s interim government has promised to free an “important number” of detainees, but as of Tuesday, only 56 had been released, the rights group said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least three Americans had been freed as of Tuesday night, according to a person briefed on the events who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivities around the diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A State Department spokeswoman said on Wednesday that she could not confirm if more Americans were detained in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15xp-grok-kqth/15xp-grok-kqth-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social media platform X said late Wednesday that it was blocking Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot created by Elon Musk, from generating sexualized and naked images of real people on its platforms in certain locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move comes amid global outrage over explicit, A.I.-generated images that have flooded X. In the last week, regulators around the world have opened investigations into Grok, and some countries have banned the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier Wednesday, investigators in California said they were examining whether Grok had violated state laws. Ofcom, Britain’s independent online safety watchdog, opened an inquiry into Grok on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a welcome development,” the British regulator said in a statement on Thursday in response to the new restrictions on Grok. “However, our formal investigation remains ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If X is found to have broken British law and refuses to comply with Ofcom’s requests for action, the regulator has the power, if necessary, to seek a court order that would prevent payment providers and advertisers from working with X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said in a statement on Wednesday that it would use “geoblocking” to restrict Grok from fulfilling requests for such imagery in jurisdictions where such content was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restrictions did not appear to apply to the stand-alone Grok app and website, outside of X. Grok and X are both owned by xAI. X did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, X announced it had limited Grok’s image-generation capabilities to subscribers, who would pay a premium for the feature, but that did little to placate regulators around the world. Indonesia and Malaysia have banned the chatbot, and the European Union has opened investigations into its explicit “deepfakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, has sharply criticized the technology. “It horrifies me that a technology platform allows users to digitally undress women and children online. It is inconceivable behavior,” she told European media outlets earlier this month. “And the harm caused by this is very real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union has powerful tools for monitoring and stalling such activity, including the Digital Services Act, which forces large technology firms to monitor content posted to their platforms — or to face consequences including major fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those regulations are often criticized by the Trump administration, which has argued that the European Union’s digital rules amount to censorship and unfairly discriminate against big American technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators in the European Union have ordered Grok to retain documents related to the chatbot as it examines its creation of sexual images. Sexual images of children are illegal to possess or share in many countries, and some also ban A.I.-generated sexual images of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several countries, including the United States and Britain, have also enacted laws against sharing nonconsensual nude imagery, often referred to as “revenge porn.” X’s policy bars users from posting “intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/14/multimedia/xx-health-funding-01-wgmz/xx-health-funding-01-wgmz-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department is negotiating agreements with countries across the developing world to provide billions of dollars in health aid, an effort intended to replace the system of global health assistance that had for decades been offered through the now-dismantled U.S. Agency for International Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past month the U.S. has signed agreements with 16 African countries to provide more than $11 billion in health aid over the next five years, and is negotiating dozens more deals with governments in Asia and Latin America as well as Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new commitments represent a steep drop in the health aid that the United States contributed before President Trump ordered a review of foreign assistance on his first day in office last year. According to an analysis by the nonprofit Partners in Health, health funding under the agreements would drop by 69 percent to Rwanda, 61 percent to Madagascar, 42 percent to Liberia and 34 percent to Eswatini, where a quarter of adults live with H.I.V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the deals are being welcomed by governments and some analysts in Africa as a significant shift that could increase country autonomy and make health systems stronger and less reliant on international largess. Others, however, say the agreements were negotiated with countries that had no leverage and demand conditions that are unattainable, especially in places where people are most in need of help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deals are guided by the administration’s global health strategy, announced in September, which emphasizes health spending that it says serves to make the United States safer and more prosperous. In Zambia, where negotiations are stalled, Washington is seeking to tie access to U.S. health funding — on which Zambia relies heavily to run a huge H.I.V. treatment program — to the signing of a separate deal for U.S. access to the country’s vast mineral resources. The proposed deal cuts Zambia’s health funding from the United States by more than 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Lewin, acting under secretary of state for foreign assistance, humanitarian affairs and religious freedom, said the agreements are the first phase of a reimagining of a failing and dysfunctional foreign aid system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That system was failing American taxpayers who were going to fund this in perpetuity,” Mr. Lewin said in an interview with The New York Times. “It was failing countries who didn’t have control over their own health sovereignty and their own health destinies. And it was failing patients, because ultimately we can only reach so many people with our foreign assistance funding and the thing that’s going to produce the best health outcomes for people in these countries is going to be for their national governments to build the capacity to take care of those populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall large drop in the funding deals contrasts sharply with a push from Congress, where the House voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to maintain funding for global health near the level it was in past years. The Senate will take up the bill later this month; the legislation proposes $9.4 billion in global health funding for the 2026 fiscal year, more than twice the $3.8 billion the administration had said it intends to spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration’s new mode of providing health aid differs significantly from the previous funding model. Now U.S. support is being conditioned on a cofinancing commitment from the partner country — Washington will give Nigeria about $2 billion over five years, for example, if the Nigerian government increases its current health budget by $3 billion in that period. In many cases, the new commitments that governments are making represent a large hike in their health spending — and it’s not clear, in countries with faltering economies and huge debt burdens, where those funds will come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will be punished sorely if the terms of the agreement aren’t met,” said Gift Trapence, who chairs a network of H.I.V. organizations in Malawi. “Yet Malawi is already struggling to finance its health system.” U.S. funding to Malawi will be cut by 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreements frame the U.S. support as a direct exchange with the African governments, reducing or eliminating the role of nongovernmental organizations. Mr. Lewin and others at the State Department have been harshly critical of the large aid organizations — known as “implementing partners” — that the United States contracted to do much of the global health work it funded in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that system, U.S.A.I.D. contracted those organizations to deliver goods and services in partner countries, sometimes working with the local health ministry, while other times acting independently. Trump administration officials have repeatedly characterized those organizations as a development mafia, saying they charged exorbitant overhead fees and were more preoccupied with ensuring their own survival than with helping countries end their reliance on foreign aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new deals, more funds will go directly to governments to deliver services, and when they need the support of partners, they will choose them with the United States and have clarity about their budgets. The lack of transparency around those budgets, and the ability of implementing partners to set heath agendas, have been points of frustration for recipient governments in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing not to like here,” said Ebenezer Obadare, a Nigerian analyst of African politics at the Council on Foreign Relations. “If there is any part of this that does not work for any African government, they are entitled to walk away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Musoba Kitui, the Nairobi, Kenya-based regional director for a health rights advocacy group, said it was absurd to suggest that this was a fair negotiation between nations. After the United States abruptly froze funding to Kenya a year ago, “the health system was on its knees, and that vulnerability made it very likely that the state would sign on to any conditions, just to get some money into the Ministry of Health,” he said. Kenya’s funding from the United States will decline by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deals have been negotiated under intense time pressure and with limited transparency. In Cameroon, the heads of key government health departments were unsure talks were even taking place until they learned a deal had been signed. In Kenya, the deal was negotiated with the Kenyan Treasury, and senior figures in the health ministry did not know its content until it was signed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compacts mean governments should be able to better integrate their health systems instead of having H.I.V. services run through one channel of U.S. funding, and malaria services another, said Dr. Kitui, who works with Ipas Africa Alliance. But what’s lost is the kind of solidarity that U.S.A.I.D. used to provide for marginalized communities — for women and girls, for people living in informal settlements or rural areas whose needs are often neglected by government. U.S.A.I.D. funded projects that provided health care to queer communities in places such as Uganda where homosexual activity is criminalized or persecuted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kitui said there is deep concern that the new deal could restrict abortion access, overriding national policies on reproductive health. A 1973 U.S. law prohibits the use of American foreign assistance funds to pay for abortion as a method of family planning, or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortion. While abortion in Kenya is legal only when deemed necessary for the life or health of the pregnant woman, in practice medical personnel interpret this broadly and include the ways mental health can be undermined by an unwanted pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, though, any aspect of the Kenyan health system that is getting U.S. funding support — such as the national medication supply chain — would theoretically be prohibited from supporting abortion, such as by stocking medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new agreements will do more government-to-government transfer in countries where there is perceived to be greater transparency, and will continue to rely on “implementing partners” in places where accountability is weaker, Mr. Lewin said. The “implementing partner” model was developed in part because of concern about high levels of corruption in some developing countries’ governments, and fear of theft or waste of resources that were U.S. taxpayer contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t see any way to make sure how this money is being used,” said Olivia Ngou, the director of Impact Santé Afrique, a health advocacy organization in Cameroon — a country with high corruption and an opaque, autocratic government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lewin said the new system will have strict audit requirements, and that if theft or graft is detected, the funding deals could be suspended or terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the negotiations have tied in explicit U.S. economic and foreign policy goals to the new health spending. The deal with Nigeria obliges the government to take steps to protect Christian victims of Muslim violence. (It says nothing about protecting Muslim victims; the majority of those who suffer at the hands of militant Islamist groups such as Boko Haram are themselves Muslim.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high court in Kenya has suspended implementation of the agreement while it evaluates concerns that several clauses violate Kenyan law. Under scrutiny are a provision that requires Kenya to send pathogen samples to the United States for 25 years — decades after the terms of the deal expire — and another that gives the United States access to national health data. (Other agreements made public also have this requirement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms for the sharing of pathogen samples was a key sticking point in negotiations for the global “pandemic treaty,” signed last year. African countries as a bloc demanded a requirement in that deal that if they shared information on pathogens, such as a virus causing a pandemic, they would also receive guaranteed access to any vaccines or treatments derived from those samples. The demand reflected frustration that Africa had largely been shut out of access to Covid shots for more than a year after they began to be widely used in industrialized countries, even though samples from Africa had contributed heavily to vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Madagascar, the loss of U.S. aid over the past year has crippled an already weak health system. The United States supplied most of the malaria tests and treatments in the country, and much of the contraception — all of which has been in short supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We see easily treatable cases of simple malaria evolving to become severe and in some cases fatal,” said Laura Cordier, director of Pivot, a Malagasy rural health organization. The new deal for U.S. funding has come more quickly than people in the country expected, she said, but a reduction of two-thirds in that funding is harsh news. “We were already trying to do the impossible with not enough,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has asked President Trump to postpone any plans for an American military attack on Iran, a senior U.S. official said on Thursday, even as the Iranian government continues to grapple with nationwide protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Netanyahu spoke to Mr. Trump on Wednesday, the same day the American president said he had received information from “very important sources on the other side” that Iran had stopped killing protesters and was not going forward with executions. That appeared to signal that Mr. Trump was backing away from a potential U.S. attack on Iran, which he has been weighing for days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Mr. Trump sent a similar ambiguous signal last June even after he had largely made up his mind to order an attack on Iran. And a senior U.S. official said late Wednesday that Mr. Trump had not set aside the military options his commanders had presented in recent days, and whether he ordered an attack depends on what Iranian security agencies do next in regard to the mass protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt, all partners of Washington, have also been asking the Trump administration not to attack Iran, said an official from a Gulf Arab nation. Senior officials from those countries have been calling U.S. officials with that message over the last two days, the official said. They have told the Americans that a U.S. attack could lead to a wider regional conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, those Arab nations have been telling Iranian officials not to attack countries in the region if the United States decides to strike Iran, the official said. The four nations have been coordinating their messaging to both Washington and Tehran, the official said. Two diplomats in the region also said several Arab nations have pressed the Trump administration not to attack Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe in dialogue and we believe in solving any disagreements at the negotiating table,” Adel al-Jubeir, the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, said at a minerals forum in Riyadh, the kingdom’s capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House declined to comment. The Israeli prime minister’s office did not have immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran ordered its air space closed to commercial flights late Wednesday, but has reopened it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials have been preparing for Iran to retaliate against an attack by striking American military assets in the region, mainly a U.S. air base in Qatar or troops stationed in Iraq and Syria. But Israel could also be a target for Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran fired many ballistic missiles at Israel during a 12-day war between the two nations in June that the United States also took part in by striking three Iranian nuclear sites. Some of the Iranian missiles got past Israeli air defenses and killed civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To retaliate against the U.S. strikes in June, Iran fired ballistic missiles at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest American military base in the Middle East. About 10,000 troops are stationed there. The Iranian barrage caused no deaths or injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent days, the Pentagon had begun moving some troops from the base as Mr. Trump weighed options for a U.S. strike on Iran. A Pentagon official said on Thursday that the Defense Department has lowered the alert level at the air base and that troops have been returning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Iranian government has cut off internet service across the country, and it has been difficult to get information about the events unfolding there. Security forces have killed hundreds or thousands of protesters to try to end the broad anti-government demonstrations that have been taking place across Iran since late December, according to Iranian officials and human rights groups outside the country. Two Iranian officials told The New York Times on Monday that at least 3,000 people had been killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has said since Jan. 2 that he could order an attack on Iran if the government harms protesters, even though he has denounced people who demonstrate against his policies in the United States. On Tuesday, he wrote on social media that Iranian protesters should take over government institutions, and that “HELP IS ON ITS WAY.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran’s judiciary said on Thursday that it had not issued a death sentence for Erfan Soltani, a protester whose execution had been widely reported as imminent and drawn international attention. The comments were reported by Iran’s state broadcaster, and were published on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is good news,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday on social media, citing an unspecified Fox News report that said an unnamed Iranian protester and others would not be sentenced to death. “Hopefully, it will continue!” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting was contributed by Eric Schmitt from Washington, Aaron Boxerman from Jerusalem, Vivian Nereim from Riyadh and Abdi Latif Dahir from Beirut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15xp-ferragni-vgqw/15xp-ferragni-vgqw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court in Milan closed a fraud case on Wednesday against Chiara Ferragni, Italy’s most famous influencer, that involved accusations of charity fraud and had prompted an exodus of sponsors and followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Ferragni, 38, had built a formidable empire online sharing the intricacies of her life. Then, she was accused of misleading consumers in 2022 with the sale of a pink-boxed Christmas cake, or pandoro, and the brewing scandal brought her unwanted attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had initially accused her of aggravated fraud and asked for a prison sentence of 20 months. But the charge was downgraded to fraud by the judge, who then dismissed it because a victim had not filed a formal complaint, as required in Italy to uphold a fraud case. Victims had previously withdrawn a complaint under the terms of a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A nightmare I have experienced for two years is over,” Ms. Ferragni told reporters outside the courtroom in Milan on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said in a social media post to her 28 million followers on Instagram on Thursday that the judge determined “that there were not even the basic grounds for a criminal trial to exist.” One of her defense lawyers, Marcello Bana, said in an interview that he hoped Milan prosecutors would not appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prosecutor on the case, Eugenio Fusco, confirmed that Ms. Ferragni had been cleared of the charges, adding that prosecutors had not determined whether they would appeal. The judge had 90 days after his decision to file his verdict, after which prosecutors could decide whether to appeal, Mr. Fusco said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Ms. Ferragni was accused of misleading consumers by endorsing a cake, produced by the Balocco bakery conglomerate, that was priced at about $10, about two and a half times more than that of a normal Balocco pandoro. In promotional messaging, Ms. Ferragni implied to her followers that sales from the cakes would go toward buying equipment for cancer treatment at a children’s hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an Italian journalist, Selvaggia Lucarelli, questioned how much of the proceeds were going to Ms. Ferragni and how much would be going to the hospital. Balocco, she reported, had already made a donation to the hospital, and Ms. Ferragni’s partnership with the bakery conglomerate was a commercial venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelation, which came to be known as “Pandoro Gate,” eventually led to a media frenzy around Ms. Ferragni, who had until then been widely known as part of a first generation of social media influencers promoting brands around their fashion choices and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2023, the Italian Competition Authority, which regulates commercial practices, fined Ms. Ferragni roughly 1.1 million euros (about $1.3 million) and Balocco 420,000 euros (about $487,000) over what it called misleading advertising. Companies affiliated with Ms. Ferragni, the authority said, had made more than 1 million euros in licensing fees, without paying anything to the children’s hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Ferragni apologized to her followers in an unusually unglamorous video, shared to Instagram in 2023, saying that she had made “a communication error” and would donate 1 million euros to the hospital. “I realize that I could have been more vigilant,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the accusations embroiled Ms. Ferragni in more scandal. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticized her in a speech, suggesting that Ms. Ferragni was not a good role model. Sponsors, among them Coca-Cola, dropped their partnerships with her, and hundreds of thousands of people on Instagram unfollowed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case against Ms. Ferragni led to tighter regulations for influencers in Italy. In November, the nation’s regulatory agency for communication industries announced new rules requiring that influencers with more than 500,000 followers on a single platform — or those who average more than 1 million viewers a month across platforms — register as a “relevant influencer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Italian consumer rights group brought a class-action suit against Ms. Ferragni in 2023, accusing her of misleading consumers. Shortly after, prosecutors in Milan said that they would investigate her. Ms. Ferragni, they said, had misled consumers previously, including on a collaboration with a sweets company in which she implied that sales from Easter eggs would go toward a charity group, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Ferragni had since settled the class action suit, agreeing to pay 150 euros, or about $174, to each buyer of the limited edition pandoro cakes and to make a donation to a foundation for female victims of domestic violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16int-theworld-well-challenge-promo/16int-theworld-well-challenge-gif-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we kicked off 2026 by featuring the 5-Day Brain Health Challenge: a set of activities from our colleagues on the Well desk designed to be good for your brain, and to tee up healthy habits for the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that self-care advice can sometimes sound a little off-key. There’s a lot happening. President Trump attacked Venezuela. Iran might be next. … Eat more berries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe the crazier the world feels, the more important it becomes to look after yourself. As my colleague Dana Smith, who designed the challenge, put it: “Regardless of what’s going on in the world, when you or your family has a health crisis, everything stops.” So, in some ways, there is nothing more important. Today I talk to Dana about how to keep your brain healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana, you do a Well challenge at the start of every year. What made you focus on brain health this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to focus on brain health because it’s a topic that touches all of us, and it’s one that can feel pretty scary and out of our control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people I know, myself included, have someone in their family who’s experienced dementia or a stroke. And there are a lot of headlines that are very doom and gloom: A million people will develop dementia every year, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t tell the whole story. I think what is less known is that there are actually things you can do to maintain your brain health. And while the number of people with dementia is rising because we have a large aging population, the rates of dementia are actually declining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is due to lifestyle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s almost entirely due to that. Our genes haven’t changed, our brains haven’t really changed, but our lifestyles have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The No. 1 thing is fewer people smoke, and that has had a really dramatic effect on people’s physical health and brain health. The other main contributor is better heart health. Your heart health and your brain health are closely linked. And so more people controlling their blood pressure, especially, has also made a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what we really wanted to get across with the Well challenge: There are clear, actionable steps that people can take to benefit their brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about those steps. In some ways your recommendations are very familiar, right? Eat well, sleep well, exercise. Why remind people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we try to do at Well is explain the science behind this type of lifestyle advice. It’s easy to kind of roll your eyes and say, “Yeah, yeah, I know.” So we want people to understand why these things help your brain stay healthy for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason exercise is so good for your brain, for example, is that there are these amazing molecules called exerkines that your muscles and other organs release. Some of them go up to your brain where they actually help to heal damaged neurons and create new connections between neurons. They can even protect your brain from shrinking with age. I mean, these are incredibly cool mechanisms that underpin this simple advice of “get some exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Feeling inspired to get moving? Read this story on the best sports for longevity, and watch the video below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical health to me is quite intuitive. Like if I exercise and I eat well, I can feel it and maybe even see it in my body. What does a healthy brain look and feel like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the clearest example of this is sleep. If you get a good night’s rest, you feel great the next day. If you have a poor night’s sleep, you feel terrible. You feel sluggish, you’re irritable, you can’t perform at your best. That, to me, really encapsulates a good brain day versus a bad brain day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that people also kind of intuitively can feel a bad brain day versus a good one. And I think what usually contributes to a good one are those small self-care steps, like going outside for a walk, that often are also the ones that benefit our physical health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is maintaining brain health any different from just maintaining overall health?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy body includes a healthy brain. I really think that they’re one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump appears to be backing away from a potential U.S. attack on Iran, which he had been weighing for days. On Wednesday, the president spoke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who asked him to postpone any plans for an American military attack on Iran, according to a U.S. official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt have also asked the Trump administration to stand down, warning that U.S. military action could lead to a wider regional conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel’s caution about a U.S. attack on Iran is well justified, experts said. The risks of blowback against Israel — including a new war — are too great. And the chances are remote that anything short of a major offensive could topple Iran’s clerical rulers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran appeared yesterday to backpedal on previous threats to execute protesters, even as the government continues a brutal crackdown after weeks of demonstrations. Here’s what Iranian officials are saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in Greenland are fearful of what might come next after a meeting with the Trump administration ended in an impasse. Several NATO countries announced plans to send troops to Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four astronauts returned home to Earth after a medical evacuation from the International Space Station. Watch them splash down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to use the military inside the U.S., to quell protests in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;María Corina Machado, the Nobel laureate and Venezuelan opposition leader, met with Trump after offering to share her prize with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uganda held a presidential election, with Yoweri Museveni, 81, widely expected to extend his rule of nearly four decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social networks in Australia removed or deleted nearly five million accounts belonging to teenagers, one month after a ban went into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least two people were killed when a crane collapsed on an expressway in Thailand — the second fatal episode involving cranes this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard, once the world’s most productive research university, has dropped to No. 3 as Chinese universities climb the rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social media platform X said it would block Grok, the A.I. chatbot created by Elon Musk, from generating sexualized and naked images of real people in some locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Football: Morocco faces Senegal on Sunday in the Africa Cup of Nations final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennis: The Australian Open begins this weekend. Here’s what to watch for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Do you remember sitting in front of the television, devouring music video after music video on MTV? This website recreates that experience. With channels arranged by era or genre, it can take you back to the days of hair metal and heartland rock, or grunge and goth, or ’90s hip-hop and R&amp;B. Read more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly two weeks of delay, my colleague Chang W. Lee, a New York Times photographer, was finally able to launch his drone to capture images of Antarctica from the air. “I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time,” he said. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chang and Raymond Zhong, a climate reporter, are traveling with a scientific expedition to study Antarctica’s fastest melting glacier. You can follow their progress here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new video game by a Chinese developer taps into fears felt by many: scams and human trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one part of the game, called “Blood Money: Lethal Eden,” a woman you met online drugs you and takes you to an office where a boss promises your freedom — but only if you can scam enough money out of unsuspecting victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People around the world have been kidnapped and forced to work in scam compounds in Southeast Asia. Scenes in the game look a lot like the images of real scam compounds, including an abandoned one that New York Times journalists recently visited in Myanmar. Read more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L’affogato al caffè, a dessert of gelato drowned in espresso, is a delectable Italian treat. The ice cream can be fior di latte, chocolate or whatever you like. The magic of affogato is that you get two pleasures in one: a spoonable dessert sauced with coffee, and a cream-blushed drink to chase it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is this city?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenyang, China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sapporo, Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innsbruck, Austria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yakutsk, Russia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love a good hustler movie.I’d been hearing all this breathless praise for “Marty Supreme,” a new movie directed by Josh Safdie about a table tennis-playing, serial-hustler-gambler-rambler in 1950s America, played by Timothée Chalamet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus in podcast interviews and countless articles seemed to be: Chalamet is totally amazing. The table tennis scenes are insane. This movie is going to blow you away. It will win every award on the planet, guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally watched “Marty Supreme” last Saturday, a day before the Golden Globes. Chalamet was amazing. The table tennis was insane. But the movie didn’t blow me away, despite the incredible hype — an example of successful hustling! (Our critic liked it more than I did, calling it electrifying.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine described “Marty Supreme” as a B-minus compared with “Uncut Gems,” a 2019 movie by Safdie and his brother, Benny. It is, well, a gem of a movie. The first time I watched it I had to stop because it was so stressful. (My muscles ached from all the clenching.) The second time I loved it so much that I watched it a third time. It may be the most exhilarating movie I’ve ever seen. Check it out: That’s my recommendation this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you need to lower your pulse afterward, listen to “Spinning Away,” a Brian Eno collab with John Cale. Dreamy and soothing. Definitely not suitable for the soundtrack of a Safdie movie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a great weekend! — Katrin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15int-venezuela-speech-Delcy-jqpb/15int-venezuela-speech-Delcy-jqpb-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her first State of the Union address on Thursday, Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela’s interim leader, walked a political tight rope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Rodríguez echoed the fiery, anti-imperialist rhetoric used by her predecessors in the speech, which she said she had co-written with Nicolás Maduro just hours before he was captured by U.S. commandos, and she launched a verbal offensive against the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, she also seemed to follow President Trump’s agenda by saying she was opening Venezuela’s oil fields, a specific demand of the U.S. government, and releasing political prisoners, which Mr. Trump has called “a very important and smart gesture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let us not be afraid of diplomacy,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has threatened Ms. Rodríguez with consequences “worse than Maduro” if she does not comply with U.S. interests. Mr. Maduro now sits in a Brooklyn prison awaiting trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, she requested attendants to honor “all the heroes and heroines who died in combat” against the United States, which she called “the invading aggressor,” and said that the capture of Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had crossed a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They attacked, assaulted, killed, invaded and kidnapped President Maduro and the first lady,” she said. “There is a stain on relations between the United States and Venezuela.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking before the National Assembly in the capital, Caracas, for about 40 minutes, Ms. Rodríguez tried to send a message of stability to a nation uncertain of its future — although some of her claims seem to be disputed by the reality on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela, she said, was already on a path of economic recovery before the recent U.S. incursion, driven primarily by the oil sector. She added that the country had achieved zero fuel imports last year, a first in over a decade, as oil production reached 1.168 million barrels per day in December, according to a slide she presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a recent survey by Gallup showed that three in five Venezuelans struggled at times to afford food last year, among the highest rate in the region. About 90 percent of Venezuelans live in poverty, according to independent watchdogs. And recent reports indicate a sharp decline in oil production because of infrastructure decay and the effects of a U.S. naval blockade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her speech, Ms. Rodríguez, who was until Mr. Maduro’s capture the country’s minister of petroleum while serving as his vice president, called on legislators to approve a bill that would allow opening oil fields “where there is no infrastructure” and “investment has never been made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move seemed designed to meet specific U.S. demands, potentially giving American oil companies access to untapped oil reserves. But the proposal might signal a departure from previous policies carried out by Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, who prioritized state-led nationalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the face of aggression and a ferocious threat, we are forging an energy partnership defined by decency, dignity and independence,” Ms. Rodríguez said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Trump dined with Venezuela’s opposition leader and the newest Nobel laureate, María Corina Machado, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, praised the interim government in Venezuela led by Ms. Rodríguez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have been extremely cooperative, and they have, thus far, met all of the demands and requests of the United States and of the president,” Ms. Leavitt told reporters. “And I think you have all seen that play out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Rodríguez, she added, had also confirmed that the Venezuelan authorities would be freeing political prisoners, highlighting the recent release of five U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her speech, Ms. Rodríguez addressed the releases — which some human rights groups estimate to be about 84 so far — although she accused political prisoners of being “foreign mercenaries who came to kill us” and of committing criminal acts “of hatred, violence and intolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, she added, the releases were approved “because President Maduro believed that we should move forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Ms. Machado said she had presented Mr. Trump with “the medal of the Nobel Peace Prize,” and Mr. Trump confirmed it. The act was seen as part of her efforts to cozy up to Mr. Trump. The Norwegian Nobel Institute previously said in a statement that the prize cannot be revoked, shared or transferred to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Ms. Machado has accused Ms. Rodríguez of being part of the Maduro administration’s repressive machinery and of acting as Venezuela’s main point of contact with Russia, China and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Venezuela has the right to relations with China, with Russia, with Cuba, with Iran, with all the peoples of the world,” Ms. Rodríguez responded during her televised speech, “and with the United States, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She then appeared to send a message to Ms. Machado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If one day, as acting president, I have to go to Washington, I will do so with my head held high, walking, not on my knees,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15int-Iran-unsc-cgtq/15int-Iran-unsc-cgtq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week of threatening to strike Iran in retaliation for the government killing protesters, the United States brought its case against the country to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the United States offered little clarity on what action, if any, it intended to take against Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., told the council that President Trump “stands by the brave people of Iran. Period,” adding that the level of violence and repression that Iran has unleashed against its own citizens had repercussions for international peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Trump is a man of action, not endless talk like we see at the United Nations,” Mr. Waltz said. “He has made it clear all options are on the table to stop the slaughter and no one should know that better than the leadership of the Iranian regime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nationwide uprising has erupted across Iran since late December. Initially fueled by a tanking economy and currency, the unrest has grown to demanding an end to nearly five decades of Islamic theocracy. After initial economic gestures to contain the unrest, Iran’s leaders cracked down violently, shutting down the internet and firing, at times seemingly indiscriminately, on unarmed protesters. An Iranian health ministry official said more than 3,000 people have been killed, including more than 100 security forces. Rights groups like the Norway-based Iran Human Rights said that more than 3,400 had been killed and thousands of others injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has swayed from saying early this month that the United States was “locked and loaded and ready to go,” and this week calling on Iranian protesters to seize government institutions because help was on the way, to announcing diplomatic negotiations were back on the table, then off, and finally suggesting Iran had heeded to his call to stop killing and executing protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia and China, permanent members of the Security Council and allies of Iran, condemned the United States, saying it was war mongering and meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation. China said U.S. military intervention would plunge the region into an abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia’s ambassador to the U.N., Vasily Nebenzya, said Mr. Trump’s rhetoric on Iran in recent days was “reckless” and amounted to “nothing but incitements to violently overthrow” the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran’s deputy ambassador to the U.N., Gholamhossein Darzi, delivered a long and fiery speech, striking a more confrontational tone than Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has in recent days. Mr. Araghchi has indicated a willingness to defuse tensions with Washington by returning to negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Darzi, however, attacked both the United Nations and the United States, labeled protesters in Iran as terrorists, and denied Iran had killed any of them, blaming the United States and Israel for the bloodshed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any act of aggression — direct or indirect — will be met with a decisive, proportionate and lawful response,” Mr. Darzi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he railed, some U.N. officials and diplomats present in the chamber appeared stunned. He also denounced the two well-known opposition activists the United States had invited to address the council, Masih Alinejad and Ahmad Batebi, as being on “Mossad’s payroll,” repeating common tropes used by the government to discredit its critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, a federal judged sentenced two men who had been hired by Iran in a plot to assassinate Ms. Alinejad in New York, where she lives. In her remarks to the council, she read the names of some of the victims who have been killed in the recent protests. “The list of names goes on and on,” Ms. Alinejad said. “They knew they would face guns and bullets, but they wanted justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Batebi recounted that when he was a university student in Iran in 1999 he was arrested for participating in protests and sentenced to death. He had drawn the authorities’ ire after a photo of him holding up the bloody shirt of a fellow student landed on the cover of the Economist magazine. He was jailed for eight years, two of which were in solitary confinement, and repeatedly tortured, including in mock executions. He escaped and came to the United States in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Batebi told the council that his body remained covered with scars from his time in prison, when interrogators cut him and poured salt over his wounds. “I can show you my body if you don’t believe me right now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning toward Mr. Darzi, the Iranian representative, he said: “I’m here in front of you — you tried to kill me but you couldn’t. You cannot kill all the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Darzi appeared to smirk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t laugh, sir, don’t laugh at me,” Mr. Batebi said, “because a day will come when you have to go to court and answer to all the things you did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15thailand-crane-wvjl/15thailand-crane-wvjl-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crane collapsed on an accident-prone expressway on the outskirts of Bangkok on Thursday, killing at least two people, the authorities said. It was the second fatal episode involving cranes in the country in as many days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government was moving to halt all aboveground construction in the wake of the episodes, Thailand’s transport minister, Phipat Ratchakitprakarn, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear what caused the crane to collapse in Samut Sakhon Province, southwest of Bangkok, on Thursday. Crews are building an elevated section of the motorway, which is not yet open to traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of the elevated structure caved in to the ground level after the crane fell. The collapse crushed two vehicles, a rescue worker said, and it was not immediately clear if there were any survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident occurred around 9:15 a.m. on Thursday in front of a hotel on the outbound lanes of the Rama 2 Road. Siwanart Jaiseukul, a security guard at the hotel, said he was about two hours into his shift when he saw the elevated motorway “snap in half.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Siwanart rushed out and saw a pile of debris, concrete, metal and a car trapped underneath the rubble, but quickly went back to the hotel because he was afraid that other parts of the structure might fall on him. He said it was lucky that it was not rush hour at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was like a movie,” Mr. Siwanart said. “I was and am still in shock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday afternoon, several ambulances lined the road leading to the accident site. Dozens of rescue workers milled around because they said they could not access the area, which was deemed unsafe by the authorities until they obtained clearance from engineers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a difficult operation because we don’t know how much the structure is damaged,” Suchart Tongseng, the rescue worker, said. “We have the tools to remove the wreckage, but the whole thing can slide down any minute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contractor of the expressway, Italian-Thai Development, was also the firm in charge of a construction site where a crane fell on a moving passenger train on Wednesday, according to Mr. Phipat. At least 32 people died in that accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm also faced scrutiny last year, when more than 90 people died after a building under construction collapsed in Bangkok after an earthquake. It was the only building that fell in Bangkok during the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last August, the Thai authorities charged 23 individuals in that collapse. It was a rare investigation for a workplace incident, but it has yet to conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian-Thai Development did not answer phone calls to its office and disabled all comments on its Facebook page on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rama 2 Road — designed to be the main artery connecting Bangkok to Thailand’s southern provinces — is often referred to by Thais as the “Road of Never-Ending Construction.” It is notorious for its frequent and often fatal accidents. The authorities have recorded at least 140 deaths from over 2,200 construction-related accidents between 2018 and 2025, and more than 1,300 injuries in the same period, according to a tally of data provided by Thailand’s Department of Highways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many laws in Thailand, safety guidelines are loosely enforced, experts say. Workers often clock more than 50 hours per week, increasing the risks of workplace injuries. Contractors often hire subcontractors who are not equipped with the knowledge and experience to work on complex, large-scale infrastructure projects. When accidents occur, the subcontractors are often the scapegoats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/world/15int-machado-nobel/15int-machado-nobel-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has made it unmistakable how he feels about last year’s Nobel Peace Prize going to a Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, and not him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I single-handedly ENDED 8 WARS, and Norway, a NATO Member, foolishly chose not to give me the Noble Peace Prize,” he said on social media last week. Beyond misspelling the award’s name, he also attributed the decision to the entire country of Norway rather than the five-member committee that makes its choices independently of the government in Oslo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Ms. Machado is expected to meet in Washington with Mr. Trump, with whom she has repeatedly sought to curry favor by proposing to share the award with him. She has cheered the U.S. military’s capture of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and remained mum about a bombing campaign against boats Mr. Trump says are smuggling drugs. The American strikes have killed more than 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thorny situation is being greeted with scorn across the Atlantic Ocean in Norway, where the prize is regarded not just as prestigious and freighted with symbolism but also the country’s prime soft-power tool. The Nobel Institute, which awards it, has been in serious damage-control mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, after Ms. Machado floated the idea of sharing the prize with Mr. Trump in a Fox News interview, the institute offered a reminder about what the rules governing the award allow, saying that the facts were “clear and well established.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared or transferred to others,” the institute wrote. “The decision is final and stands for all time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day before Ms. Machado arrived in Washington, Kristian Harpviken, the director of the institute, who is also the secretary of the committee that chooses award recipients, said he would not be drawn further into the deepening controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The prize is awarded on the basis of the laureate’s contributions by the time that the committee’s decision is taken,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That explanation has been insufficient for many Norwegians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A Nobel committee can never guard against peace prize laureates committing acts that run counter to the intention of the prize,’’ Lena Lindgren, a columnist for the Norwegian weekly Morgenbladet, said in an interview. “But what is new now is that the prize is being used in a political game, a warlike game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what Ms. Machado hopes to gain out of her meeting with Mr. Trump. After ousting Mr. Maduro, he declined to install her in power, saying “she’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect” needed to lead the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independently verified vote counts in Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election showed that Ms. Machado’s party had beaten Mr. Maduro by a wide margin. The Venezuelan authorities nonetheless declared Mr. Maduro the victor, and his government embarked on a harsh repression campaign against critics of the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is far from the first time the Nobel committee has been criticized for its choice, or been accused of abetting violent leaders or governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global outrage followed the choice of President Barack Obama, who at the time was presiding over military engagements on several continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And less than a year after receiving the award, Abiy Ahmed, the president of Ethiopia, embarked on a scorched-earth campaign in his country’s Tigray region that left hundreds of thousands dead, wounded and starving. Henry Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ were awarded the prize before a cease-fire to end the Vietnam War broke down, with Mr. Kissinger ultimately trying to return the prize amid a wave of protests. His North Vietnamese counterpart rejected it outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the dispute swirling around Ms. Machado unusual, according to Asle Sveen, a former researcher at the Nobel Institute, is Norwegians’ particularly dim view of Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Machado “has dedicated her Peace Prize to a highly controversial president, to put it mildly,” he said. “It is nearly universally accepted in Norway that Donald Trump attacks liberal democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Norwegian tabloid, Nettavisen, conducted a poll before the announcement of the award that found three-quarters of respondents were against it being bestowed on Mr. Trump, even if he were instrumental in orchestrating a peace agreement in Ukraine or Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Nobel Committee has compromised the prize” by not foreseeing how Ms. Machado and Mr. Trump would use it to justify military intervention in Venezuela, Ms. Lindgren said. “Norway has been politically embarrassed and has failed to manage the symbolic capital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the 2024 election in Venezuela, Ms. Machado went into hiding for more than a year. In December, she secretly left Venezuela to receive her award in Norway. She missed the award ceremony but appeared in Oslo to greet supporters. Her escape was orchestrated by a company run by U.S. veterans with special operations and intelligence training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Ms. Machado did not respond to requests for comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American lawmakers, including Marco Rubio, who was then a Republican senator from Florida and is now Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, had written a letter to the Nobel Committee in 2024 advocating that they award Ms. Machado the peace prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They noted her “peaceful resistance to tyrants” and her “unwavering moral compass,” and said that her efforts showed the “urgent need for international solidarity in the face of aggressive and expansive authoritarianism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is little doubt that Ms. Machado has long risked her safety to challenge an authoritarian government that jails opponents, tortures critics and censors the press. But she has also embraced Mr. Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, repeated debunked claims that Mr. Maduro manipulated U.S. elections and parroted the Trump administration’s claim that Mr. Maduro simultaneously led two drug organizations, despite scant evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her assertions fueled accusations that she was amplifying misinformation in what, until now, seemed a failed attempt to gain the American president’s support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, not all Norwegians agree that the award to Ms. Machado was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If turned out that she supported the U.S. boat strikes, that would not be the best reflection on a laureate, said Marianne Dahl, research director at the Peace Research Institute Oslo. But Ms. Machado was awarded for her pro-democracy work in 2024, Ms. Dahl said. She drew similarities between Ms. Machado and past winners who led popular movements in Nazi Germany, apartheid South Africa and Soviet republics, as well as during the so-called Arab Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is easy to sit in comfortable Norway and criticize her for talking sweet to Trump,” Ms. Dahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, she noted, is exactly what many European and even Norwegian leaders have done. “And they don’t have a repressive regime pursuing them, as Machado has had,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15int-oz-socialmedia-kbgc/15int-oz-socialmedia-kbgc-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly five million social media accounts belonging to Australian teenagers have been deactivated or removed, a month after a landmark law barring those younger than 16 from using the services took effect, the government said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement was the first reported metric reflecting the rollout of the law, which is being closely watched by several other countries weighing whether the regulation can be a blueprint for protecting children from the harms of social media, or a cautionary tale highlighting the challenges of such attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law required 10 social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and Reddit, to prevent users under 16 from accessing their services. Under the law, which came into force in December, failure by the companies to take “reasonable steps” to remove underage users could lead to fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars, about $33 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has praised the law as a world-first attempt to shield young teens from the mental health detriments and potential abuses of social media. On Thursday, he said it was encouraging to see social media companies making a meaningful effort to keep children off their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Change doesn’t happen overnight,” he said. “But these early signs show it’s important we’ve acted to make this change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of removed accounts offered only a limited picture of the ban’s impact. Many teenagers have said in the weeks since the law took effect that they were able to get around the ban by lying about their age, or that they could easily bypass verification systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country’s online safety regulator tasked with enforcing and tracking the law, the eSafety Commissioner, did not release a detailed breakdown beyond announcing that the companies had “removed access” to about 4.7 million accounts belonging to children under 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said this week that it had removed almost 550,000 accounts of users younger than 16 before the ban came into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several governments around the world, including Denmark, the European Union, France, New Zealand and Malaysia, have said they are considering similar bans. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain told members of Parliament this week that he was considering it, according to reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Inman Grant, the eSafety Commissioner, acknowledged there would still be some underage teenagers on social media, but said the law’s success should ultimately be measured by a broader reduction in harm that could take years to become apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Speed limits, for instance, are not a failure because some people speed,” she said. “Most would agree that roads are safer because of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Okill, 15, was among the teenagers who found themselves locked out of their social media accounts last month. He had built a following of 1,500 people on Instagram, which he used to connect with his peers and promote his political podcast, “Your First Vote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was quite frankly annoyed when I opened my phone, went on Instagram to check what’s happening, and it just said I’m logged out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack said he created a new Instagram account using his mother’s details to post his content until he turns 16 later this year, when he will be able to reclaim his old account. His mother manages the new account, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he understood the need to limit exposure to harmful content and to stop online abuse, he said the government should have forced companies to make their platforms a safe place for children, rather than impose a blanket ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m old enough to know what’s happening in the world,” he said. “But the government is treating us like children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Australian teen, 14-year-old Raeve, said that he was able to continue using his YouTube account by changing his age and that his account on Reddit remained active. Most of his peers seem unaffected by the ban, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s undoubtedly done nothing, from my view,” said Raeve, who asked that he only be identified by his first name because he is a minor. His father was prompted by YouTube on his own account to verify his age with an ID or a photo, while Raeve’s account was not flagged, according to the teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he was well attuned to the pitfalls of social media, having been bullied for videos he posted when he was 9 years old. He has also observed a schoolmate who appeared to become steeped in far-right, racist views from things he was exposed to on social media, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Raeve was happy that he could still access his accounts, he said he was disappointed in what he felt was an inadequate effort by the government to make sure that young people were more thoroughly protected from the dangers of social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics of the law have also cautioned that a blanket ban may disproportionately affect minorities, teens living in remote areas who connect with peers online, or young people living with disabilities who may have found communities through social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15int-uk-conservatives-01-jvlg/15int-uk-conservatives-01-jvlg-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior lawmaker for Britain’s Conservative Party was accused on Thursday of “plotting” to defect to a rival party and was ousted, highlighting the fierce competition that is underway for the future of the country’s political right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservatives, said on social media that she had fired Robert Jenrick, one of the party’s leading lawmakers, after being “presented with clear, irrefutable evidence” that he wanted to leave in a way that would cause maximum damage to his longtime party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Badenoch did not name the party, but Mr. Jenrick, who has hard-right views, had been rumored to be considering defecting to Reform U.K., the right-wing populist party led by Nigel Farage. Mr. Jenrick did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her surprise move came after a string of Conservative politicians across the country joined Reform, which has surged in popularity since the last general election and has led the polls for almost a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jenrick’s dismissal followed an announcement on Monday that Nadhim Zahawi, a former Conservative minister who once served as chancellor, had joined Reform, citing the need for “a glorious revolution.” On Wednesday, Reform officials announced that 14 local Conservative council members had switched to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defections are a boost for Mr. Farage, whose anti-immigrant views and Trump-like populism have transformed Reform from a fringe party into a political powerhouse on the right. Public surveys show Mr. Farage and his party with strong support across some parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has largely come at the expense of the Conservatives, who dominated British politics for decades. The party of Margaret Thatcher and Boris Johnson now consistently trails behind Reform in the polls, although in recent weeks it has regained a little ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reform’s popularity has also altered the political debate for Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his struggling Labour Party. Mr. Starmer and his allies have increasingly taken aim at Mr. Farage and Reform as they try to claw back the support that helped them win the general election in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The British public are tired of political psychodrama and so am I,” Ms. Badenoch said. “They saw too much of it in the last government, they’re seeing too much of it in THIS government. I will not repeat those mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked at a news conference on Thursday after the dismissal whether Mr. Jenrick was about to be unveiled as a new member of Reform, Mr. Farage said: “Is he one of many that I’ve talked to about what the future might look like? Absolutely. Have I signed a deal with him? No.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Farage added that Reform would “welcome” further defections from people who shared the party’s beliefs and said he would call Mr. Jenrick to “see what he wants to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jenrick became one of Britain’s youngest-ever government ministers in 2019 and later served as minister for immigration for 11 months. He was appointed as a Conservative centrist and a loyalist to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and was seen as a moderating force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he later had a political transformation. After the Conservatives lost power in July 2024, he became increasingly vocal on social media and garnered a large following on X, sharing videos in which he challenged fare dodgers on the London Underground and took up divisive positions on migration and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/02/multimedia/15int-mexico-troops/02mexico-tariffs-explainer-jcvz-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States is intensifying pressure on Mexico to allow U.S. military forces to conduct joint operations to dismantle fentanyl labs inside the country, according to American officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The push comes as President Trump presses on the Mexican government to grant the United States a larger role in the battle against drug cartels that produce fentanyl and smuggle it into the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal was first raised early last year and then largely dropped, officials said. But the request was renewed after U.S. forces captured President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela on Jan. 3 and has involved the highest levels of government, including the White House, according to multiple officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials want American forces — either Special Operation troops or C.I.A. officers — to accompany Mexican soldiers on raids on suspected fentanyl labs, according to American officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues and military planning. Such joint operations would be a significant expansion of the United States’ role in Mexico, and one that the Mexican government has so far adamantly opposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has repeatedly said that the two nations would work together to fight the cartels but that her government rejected the U.S.’s proposal of sending American troops across the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump “generally insists on the participation of U.S. forces,” she said in a news conference shortly after speaking with Mr. Trump on the phone Monday morning. “We always say that it is not necessary,” she said, adding, “he was receptive, listened, gave his opinion, and we agreed to continue working” together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House declined to comment. But last week, Mr. Trump told Fox News that more needed to be done in Mexico to counter the drug cartels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve knocked out 97 percent of the drugs coming in by water, and we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels,” he said, specifically those in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of joint operations, Mexican officials offered counter proposals this month, including increased information sharing and for the United States to play a greater role inside command centers, according to a person familiar with the matter. U.S. advisers are already in Mexican military command posts, according to American officials, sharing intelligence to help Mexican forces in their antidrug operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexican officials are under pressure to reach an agreement, as some American officials would like to see the U.S. military or C.I.A. conduct drone strikes against suspected drug labs, a violation of Mexican sovereignty that would significantly weaken the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But fentanyl labs are notoriously difficult to find and destroy, U.S. officials say, and Washington is still developing tools to trace the drug as it is being produced. The labs emit less chemical traces than meth labs — which can be detected by drones — and are often cooked in urban areas with the rudimentary tools found in a family kitchen, according to current and former officials. Meth and cocaine labs, however, need much larger spaces, making them easier to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Biden administration, the C.I.A. began carrying out secret drone flights over Mexico to identify possible locations of fentanyl labs, an operation that has expanded since Mr. Trump took office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drones are used both to find labs and track precursor chemicals as they arrive in Mexican seaports and then transported to their destinations, according to an American official briefed on the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That intelligence is currently handed off to Mexican military units, many of which have been trained by American Special Operation forces. Mexican troops then plan and execute the raids to take out the labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Washington’s new proposal, American forces would participate in the raids with Mexican forces in the lead, commanding the mission and making key decisions, according to people familiar with the talks, including American officials. But U.S. forces would be in support, providing intelligence and advice to frontline Mexican troops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the planning for Mexico, the Defense Department said in a statement that it “stands ready to execute the orders of the commander-in chief at any time and in any place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the C.I.A. declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of this month’s Venezuela raid seems to have emboldened the Trump administration. Soon after that operation, Mr. Trump said regime change in Cuba was next and resurrected demands that Washington take control of Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Washington has focused on Mr. Maduro and Venezuela as a main source of the drugs smuggled into the United States, the South American country in fact plays a minor role in the illicit trade. The majority of drugs smuggled into the United States come through the 2,000-mile border it shares with Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fentanyl is also responsible for the bulk of overdose deaths in the United States, and is by far the most dangerous street drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the White House designated fentanyl as a “weapon of mass destruction” and several Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration started pushing for U.S. forces inside Mexico shortly after coming to power last year, but Mexican officials have consistently rejected those proposals, demanding that Washington respect their sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have highly trained army units and special forces,” Mexico’s security chief, Omar García Harfuch, said in an interview last month. “What would they be needed for?” he added, referring to U.S. forces. “What we need is information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American troops operating inside Mexico is a particularly fraught issue, considering the shared history — the United States has invaded Mexico nearly a dozen times and launched several land grabs that included Texas and California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That deep distrust has gradually diminished over the last three decades, with Mexico working more closely with American forces and sharing more intelligence, particularly with agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Mr. Harfuch said that fewer than several hundred U.S. security personnel are in Mexico, and that all are unarmed and all are approved by Mexican officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.E.A. agents in Mexico mostly build cases with Mexican forces, and are barred from participating in antidrug ground operations. But former American officials who have worked with Mexican forces say that if Mr. Trump pushes too far that cooperation could break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Sheinbaum is in a precarious situation. If she accepts Washington’s demands for joint operations with U.S. forces, she could see a revolt within her own political party, a leftist organization that harbors deep suspicion of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the Trump administration decides to launch a unilateral military strike inside Mexico without the Mexican leader’s knowledge, she could rapidly lose support within her ruling party and among Mexican voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal for joint operations also runs up against recent Mexican laws that restrict foreign troops on Mexican soil, including a constitutional amendment passed last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the attack in Venezuela, the Mexican Senate delayed its Jan. 5 vote to allow U.S. Navy special forces into Mexico for joint training exercises beginning later this month. The senate is required under the country’s constitution to grant approval for the entry of foreign troops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Sheinbaum, who had originally requested the entry of the U.S. troops, denied last week that the delay was related to the Venezuela attack, saying it was because the Senate was not yet in session, but a Mexican senator said the postponement was indeed because of the U.S. action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Sheinbaum has tapped Mr. Harfuch to go harder on the cartels since coming to power in late 2024. Since then, Mexico has deployed hundreds of forces to the state of Sinaloa to counter the Sinaloa Cartel, the world’s largest distributor of fentanyl, leading to high-profile arrests and a splintering and weakening of the drug organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government says it is arresting cartel members and destroying drug labs at nearly four times the rate of the previous government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not saying the problem is solved,” Mr. Harfuch said. But, he added, “what we’re doing is hitting the criminal structure at the bottom, in the middle and at the top.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15int-greenland-gplh/15int-greenland-gplh-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what Greenlanders are asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big meeting in Washington over Greenland’s future happened on Wednesday. It was historic because Greenland was included for the first time at such high levels. Its foreign minister sat down with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to talk about the gigantic icebound island that has been part of Denmark for more than 300 years but that President Trump insists the United States should take over, possibly with military force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope was to work out a compromise, find some path forward. But the conclusion from Denmark’s foreign minister, who was also there, was that a “fundamental disagreement” remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Honestly, I feel flat. And I’m disappointed,” said Paalo Kuitse, a mechanic in the southern town of Qaqortoq. “What we are missing are answers about what will happen next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m afraid the next step from the U.S. will be harsh,” he said, adding, “The U.S. has the biggest military machine in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Danish political establishment, even opposition parties, has tried to put the best face on the meeting. Some politicians even called it “diplomacy at its best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would have been completely naive to believe that the threat of taking over Greenland would go away,” said Rasmus Jarlov, a conservative lawmaker. But, he said, at least the officials didn’t start arguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland’s 57,000 people have been watching all this unfold in disbelief. For generations, they have mostly been left alone to survive in one of the coldest, most barren and remote places on the planet. They have built a blended lifestyle, adhering to traditions like hunting seals and whales while also enjoying a high Scandinavian standard of living. Polls and interviews indicate that most don’t want to ditch their free education and free health care for an American system of vast inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many took great pride in seeing their foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, standing in Washington on Wednesday and speaking Greenlandic to a bank of reporters, saying it was important for her to communicate to her people back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a cafe in Nuuk broadcast the news live, people started clapping when she spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You feel relieved when you hear it, but you never really know what will happen,” said Agnetha Mikka Petersen, who was watching the broadcast with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she had a dream that American ships and planes bombed Nuuk’s airport. “I’m afraid of what could happen to Greenland — and what could happen to Denmark,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Greenlanders say what people all over the world say about Mr. Trump: that he’s highly unpredictable. On Wednesday, the president seemed to strike a more measured tone. When asked by a reporter if he would use force to acquire Greenland, a threat he has repeatedly made, he said: “You’re saying that. I didn’t say it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He emphasized — again — that Greenland was crucial for the United States’ security and that Denmark can’t defend it in today’s world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there’s everything we can do,” he said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he added: “I have a very good relationship with Denmark, and we’ll see how it all works out. I think something will work out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump consistently glides past the fact that because Greenland is part of Denmark, and Denmark part of NATO, the United States would in any case be obliged to defend Greenland if Russia or China attacked, something analysts say is remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign policy scholars tried to find some positive embers. The meeting might not have broken the impasse, said Penny Naas, senior vice president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a policy organization focused on trans-Atlantic cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But it also didn’t result in the worse-case scenario,” she said. “It bought time for each side to explore the issue further and to see where there might be potential compromises that don’t violate anyone’s red lines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, came out of the meeting looking deflated and said that a “working group” would convene in the coming weeks. Marisol Maddox, a senior fellow at the Institute of Arctic Studies at Dartmouth University, called that “a positive, concrete step.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible compromise, she said, would be to “tweak” the existing America-Danish defense agreements that already give the United States sweeping military access to Greenland and “develop something the Trump administration could own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Greenlanders aren’t so hopeful about all this working out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need economic security and lower costs of living. Those are the things we have to deal with together — instead of being spectators,” said Jens Peter Lange, a dental technician in Illulissat, a town in western Greenland, who also works as a commercial fishermen to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He dismissed the working group as “just a talking club for civil servants” that would rack up high bills flying between capitals and buying duty-free goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If they can’t give me a tool to sell my fish at a better price,” he said, “then it’s not for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15int-cuba-mpwk/15int-cuba-mpwk-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuban national television broadcast live on Thursday morning the return of the remains of 32 of its citizens, who were killed in the U.S. strikes on Venezuela during the operation in the early morning of Jan. 3 to capture the ousted Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remains arrived in boxes, smaller than caskets, draped in the Cuban flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, Cuba has sent thousands of its citizens to Venezuela, which, in turn, provided Cuba with oil. Many of the Cubans sent to Venezuela are teachers and doctors, but they also include intelligence agents and security guards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported in December that, in the face of increasing U.S. military pressure, Mr. Maduro had expanded the role of Cuban bodyguards in his personal security detail and placed more Cuban counterintelligence agents in Venezuela’s military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remains were received at Havana’s international airport by Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and the country’s Minister of the Interior, Maj. Gen. Lázaro Alberto Álvarez Casas, among other high-ranking officials in the Cuban Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The enemy speaks euphorically of high-precision operations, of elite troops, of supremacy. We, on the other hand, speak of faces, of families who lost their father, their son, their husband, their brother,” said Mr. Álvarez, speaking at the airport. “People do not become great because of their material wealth, but because of their ability to keep the memory of their heroes alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ousting of Mr. Maduro was a significant blow to Cuba, which relied heavily on Venezuelan oil to keep its economy afloat. Venezuelan oil shipments to Cuba have essentially ceased. Experts have described Cuba’s economy as being in “free fall” since the U.S. government cut off the supply of Venezuelan oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, President Trump said in a social media post that “no more oil or money” would be going to Cuba from Venezuela, and that the United States military would be involved in enforcing a separation between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Venezuela doesn’t need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Venezuela now has the United States of America, the most powerful military in the World (by far!), to protect them, and protect them we will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss of Venezuelan oil would be “catastrophic” for Cuba, according to Jorge Piñon, a former oil executive in Mexico and an expert on the energy industry at the University of Texas at Austin, who said that Venezuela had been supplying roughly a third of Cuba’s daily fuel needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/14/multimedia/14int-israel-iran-01-whjk/14int-israel-iran-01-whjk-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No country is watching the protests in Iran with greater interest than Israel, which sees the Islamic Republic as a mortal enemy and an existential threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran has been the obsession of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who has portrayed the government in Tehran and its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as a global menace on the order of Nazi Germany. The two countries fought a 12-day war last June in which Israel, briefly joined by the United States, bombed Iranian military and nuclear sites while Iran bombarded Israel with ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israelis would cheer if the Iranian regime were to fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet former officials and analysts say that the Israeli leadership is unlikely to do much to try to precipitate a regime change, seeing the Iranian government as far from the brink of collapse and the current protests as insufficient to push it to that point. Israel is unlikely to attack Iran unless it is invited into a U.S.-led operation, or unless Iran attacks Israel first, they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And its caution about a U.S. attack on Iran is well justified, experts said. The risks of blowback against Israel — including a new war — are too great. And the chances that anything short of a major offensive could topple Iran’s authoritarian clerical rulers are too remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how Israel views the protests and its own options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli analysts predict that the current wave of demonstrations in Iran will be short-lived. The protesters lack leadership and the means to defend themselves, they said, pointing to reports this week that Iranian security forces had killed thousands of demonstrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there were millions of people on the street, it would be very difficult to stop them. You cannot kill everyone,” said Sima Shine, a veteran former Iran expert at Israel’s Mossad spy agency. “But we don’t see millions. We see thousands. And this regime knows how to handle that. Their first tool is to kill people, and to make sure that everybody knows that they’re killing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli analysts say the protests are being suppressed in part by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its volunteer militia, the Basij.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are highly motivated to defend the existing power structure because their fates are tied to that of the government, which has brutalized the Iranian people for years, said Zohar Palti, formerly the head of the Mossad’s intelligence directorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the regime changes, they’re dead,” he added. “That’s the reason they’re killing people in the streets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful uprising would require a well-organized opposition capable of keeping pressure on Iran even in the face of sustained, violent repression, said Eyal Hulata, who was Israel’s national security adviser from 2021 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is something that is lacking in Iran, and this is the main reason why everyone is a bit skeptical that this might actually succeed,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using tools like social media to amplify opposition voices or cyberattacks to sabotage the government — the kinds of things that can be done from afar, apart from military action — is not enough to threaten the Islamic Republic, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t seen that cyber knows how to collapse countries,” Mr. Palti said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with Iran cutting off the internet and stifling independent reporting on the protests, it has been difficult even for Israel — whose intelligence service has repeatedly embarrassed the Iranians with its ability to operate in their country — to obtain an accurate picture of the situation on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which underscores the difficulties of toppling a government from afar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Israel cannot change the regime in Iran,” Mr. Hulata said. “Israel can provide assistance to opposition groups, maybe exert a little bit of influence,” he added. “But this in itself is not sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could make a difference in Iran, several experts said, is a much bigger military action hampering the government’s ability to crack down on the protests. That could entail targeting Revolutionary Guard forces, the Basij, or Iran’s command-and-control systems. That is no small challenge in such a vast country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli leaders would also welcome an attack on Iran’s ballistic missiles and missile factories, which they and other countries in the region see as threats and which Iran considers a vital deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But such a strike would not be for Israel to mount, analysts said. It would be up to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, for Israel, the likely gains from any intervention in Iran are far outweighed by the risks of intervening, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most of the options are bad for Israel,” said Danny Citrinowicz, a former Iran expert for Israeli military intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Israel, the biggest risk is that its actions give credence to the Iranian government’s assertion that foreign provocateurs are behind these protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel is “doing the utmost to be seen as looking at events from the outside,” Mr. Citrinowicz said, lest Iran use evidence of any overt Israeli actions to justify the use of force against protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an obscure Israeli government minister told a radio interviewer that the country had operatives in Iran “right now,” Mr. Netanyahu ordered officials to stop giving interviews on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the risk of blowback directly against Israel at a time when it already has troops in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Syria and Lebanon, and is still replenishing its stocks of defensive munitions after two years of fending off attacks from multiple countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Israeli intervention detected by Iran could increase the likelihood of a serious miscalculation by Tehran, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Iran believes Israel is building up to an attack, it could mount a pre-emptive strike against Israel. Israel’s air force could be expected to respond with force, given how poorly Iran’s air defenses performed in the June war. But experts say it would make little sense to put Israeli citizens at risk if such an intervention has little chance of toppling the regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli national-security experts spoke with great respect for U.S. military capabilities to threaten the Iranian government. But they also said that a limited American action, like a symbolic strike on a few targets, could be counterproductive, especially if the United States were to follow up by agreeing to new talks with Iran on its nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Shine said that would amount to a betrayal of the Iranian protesters, whom Mr. Trump has repeatedly encouraged, unless the United States imposed preconditions that aided the protesters, like restoring internet service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Ms. Shine said, negotiations would raise the possibility that Iran could reach an agreement with the United States that lifts economic sanctions on Tehran but — like the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran, which Mr. Netanyahu adamantly opposed — doesn’t restrict its ballistic-missile arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was always for an agreement,” Ms. Shine said. “But this regime is so bad, and what they’re doing now is so bad that you ask yourself if it’s not time to do everything you can to see that it collapses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran, has put himself forward as a future leader of Iran. Mr. Netanyahu welcomed him to Israel in 2023, and some ministers in his government have promoted Mr. Pahlavi online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some demonstrators in Iran appear to be rallying around him, judging from videos that show crowds raising the flag flown by his father’s monarchy and chanting, “Long live the shah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Israeli national security experts were skeptical of Mr. Pahlavi’s ability to rally significant Iranian support, saying he lacked experience, charisma and a meaningful base inside the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Citrinowicz, the former Israeli military analyst, said it was a mistake for Mr. Pahlavi to meet with Mr. Netanyahu and for Israeli officials to continue to amplify him because it associates the idea of regime change with Israel. That risks alienating some potential demonstrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also little chance of Mr. Pahlavi returning to Iran, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most Iranians,” he said, “don’t want to replace one dictator with another.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15int-uganda-elections-1-pjhg/15int-uganda-elections-1-pjhg-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugandans headed to the polls on Thursday for an election in which President Yoweri Museveni, 81, is expected to extend his rule of nearly four decades in the east African nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vote is taking place against the backdrop of an internet blackout imposed by the authorities. Technical problems with the biometric voting machines introduced in recent weeks in a bid to prevent voting fraud have caused widespread disruptions at polling places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By midmorning, few people had cast their ballots, with lines forming at polling stations in the capital, Kampala, and elsewhere. “I am ready to wait,” said Ssenyondwa Martha, who said she had arrived at her polling station in Kampala around sunrise. “We came here to vote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electoral commission announced on Thursday that the country’s more than 50,000 polling stations would revert to paper verification for voter identities for the rest of the day, according to the spokesman, Julius Mucunguzi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven candidates are contesting the election, but Mr. Museveni’s main challenger is Bobi Wine, the former pop star whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the support of Uganda’s young voters, Mr. Wine’s campaign rattled the ruling National Resistance Movement during the last election in 2021. In an interview on Monday, Mr. Wine acknowledged that recent defections had weakened his campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We code-named this a ‘protest vote,’” he said. “If the vote is rigged, we shall call for protests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to journalists after voting near his home in rural western Uganda on Thursday, Mr. Museveni accused the opposition of fraudulently obtaining millions of extra votes during the previous election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any opposition candidate in Uganda must contend with the overwhelming financial and political advantages of a ruling party that is deeply embedded in the state machinery. The entire electoral commission is selected by the president, who has been in power for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one example of the ruling party’s dominance, Kampala has for weeks been plastered with posters promoting Mr. Museveni and his party’s candidates for Parliament. The posters, in the party’s color yellow, dwarf the number of posters from Mr. Wine’s National Unity Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an apparent bid to forestall any opposition demonstrations, the authorities cut the internet nationwide on Tuesday, justifying the decision on the grounds that it would stop the weaponization of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ugandan government has been accused of weakening civil society groups over the years, with the country’s bureau for nongovernmental organizations closing several such groups in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Center for Constitutional Governance said on Tuesday that it had received a letter from the government accusing it of engaging “in activities which are prejudicial to the security and laws of Uganda,” and that it was being forced to close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Uganda Law Society condemned the decision. “This action, taken just days before the general election, is not coincidental,” the society said, calling it an effort to silence civil society and an “attack the public’s right to accountability.” The Center for Constitutional Governance monitors the health of the country’s democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations human rights agency said Wednesday that the internet blackout and suspension of civil society groups were “deeply worrying,” with Amnesty International calling for the immediate lifting of the internet restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Museveni has campaigned on the slogan “Protecting the Gains” made since he fought his way to power as the head of a rebellion in 1986. He said at his final campaign on Tuesday that the economy had grown 17-fold during his tenure and now exports products such as milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making sure that all Ugandans benefit from the country’s economic gains was a priority for his next term, he said. “Love Uganda. Why? Because you need it for your own good,” Mr. Museveni told journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Uganda’s economy lags behind its eastern neighbor Kenya, the country is a diplomatic powerhouse in the region and the largest contributor to a peacekeeping force in Somalia. Ugandan troops are also stationed in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in South Sudan, where they support the president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ugandan government, like many others in Africa, has been at pains to manage its relationship with the Trump administration. The State Department said on Wednesday that it would suspend the processing of immigrant visas for people from 75 countries, including Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election results are expected to be announced over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15int-ukraine-kyiv-dispatch-1-wflz/15int-ukraine-kyiv-dispatch-1-wflz-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They lived in a comfortable, spacious apartment in a fashionable neighborhood of Kyiv, what they called “our little fortress” through years of war. Even after it was damaged in a missile strike, they stayed put in the Ukrainian capital, renting another apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this week, Russian drone and missile strikes left Kyiv in the grip of its worst heating and electricity outage of the war. The couple, Yulia Mykhailiuk, a lawyer, and Ihor Honcharuk, a TV station manager, could see their breath indoors as temperatures outside peaked around 12 degrees Fahrenheit. Mr. Honcharuk jury-rigged a heater by placing a brick over a gas burner on the stove, to little avail. They had had enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They bundled their 1-year-old son in a car and abandoned Kyiv for a relative’s home in a village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to say this is uncomfortable,” Ms. Mykhailiuk said before leaving town. Her son, Markiian, was swaddled in a ball of fleeces and vests, his arms jutting out awkwardly. “This is much more than uncomfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Kyiv has entered a deep winter freeze, Russia has intensified a campaign to knock out the city’s heating and electrical infrastructure. The attacks are intended to dent the population’s morale and pressure the government to make concessions in peace talks brokered by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that Kyiv, a city of three million, has endured power cuts as Russia has tried and failed to freeze Ukraine’s largest city. This year, though, Russian missile and drone attacks are having a serious impact. Power has been out for days on end. About 500 apartment buildings have no heat at all, city authorities said, the most dramatic breakdown so far in the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of the fighting has raged at a distance from Kyiv, in the country’s east, the capital is still a symbolic prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is out of reach of Russian ground forces but within range of exploding drones and missiles. Russia’s goal is to render it uninhabitable. While Kyiv has carried on remarkably well through the years of war, it is most vulnerable when the weather turns cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first winter after the all-out invasion in February 2022, Moscow tried to bring down the nationwide grid. That proved too ambitious, as Ukraine coped by rerouting electricity around damaged equipment. Other strategies have included targeting transformer stations serving nuclear plants, major sources of power for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This winter, Russia narrowed its focus to three cities — Kyiv, Odesa and Dnipro — said Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Energy Industry Research Center, a consulting company. Russia’s aim seems to be to isolate these cities from the national network and then blow up their power plants. Volleys are repeated about every two weeks, timed to disrupt repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They try to hit areas where maintenance is in progress,” he said. “We have a lot of wounded and killed energy workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, Russia hit transformer substations in and around Kyiv. Those strikes cut the capital from power elsewhere in the country. Russia also hit all three natural gas and coal-burning power plants in Kyiv, shutting down the city’s internal sources of heat and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lights in the city blinked out. Kyiv became an icy tableau of trees coated in hoarfrost and snowbanks glistening in the winter sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the city, which typically consumes about 2,000 megawatts of electricity, was surviving on less than a tenth of that, Mr. Kharchenko said. The authorities routed what power there was to water pumps, the subway and other critical infrastructure. Most residential buildings were cut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As temperatures plunged, the heating, too, went out for many of Kyiv’s residents. The city’s power plants produce both electricity and hot water through a district heating system. The authorities rerouted hot water from a network of gas-powered boilers to compensate. They provide far less heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are fighting to survive,” Vitali Klitschko, Kyiv’s mayor and a former heavyweight boxing champion, said in an interview on Tuesday during a visit to a retirement home now heated by an emergency boiler. Russia, he said, “is trying to destroy the mood of the population.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Putin doesn’t need us as a population,” Mr. Klitschko said of President Vladimir V. Putin’s attempt to conquer the country. “He needs property. He needs Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city’s air defense shield is running low on ammunition, he said, particularly American-made Patriot interceptors. He appealed to Ukraine’s Western allies to increase supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a question of the lives of the civilian population,” he said. “Please help us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeated strikes are complicating repairs, Mr. Klitschko said. Some infrastructure that Russia hit in Friday’s barrage was hit again on Monday night, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Klitschko has asked residents to temporarily move in with relatives in other towns if they can, in case conditions in the capital unravel. But he is not calling for a sweeping evacuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia’s strikes have stirred political infighting, reviving concerns that Ukrainians might turn on one another amid the hardship. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Mr. Klitschko’s office had “done very little” to prepare for the Russian attacks. Mr. Klitschko said that city workers had done all they could, and that politics should wait. The two are longtime rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One recent day in a Kyiv neighborhood, the sun glistened off shards of glass like thousands of tiny mirrors as residents swept up and nailed tarpaulins over broken windows. A Russian drone had apparently missed its target and hit a housing block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volodymyr Dorodko, 23, a lawyer, had slept the night before in his down parka. After the overnight explosion nearby, he was out looking at the debris, including wispy flakes of black carbon fiber composite from the drone’s wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is now a daily scene in Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are tired,” Mr. Dorodko said. The hardships, he added, are pushing some Ukrainians to argue that the war should be ended even at a steep cost like territorial concessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The mothers of sons in the army are saying it directly: Let’s give them the Donbas, so people don’t die and we aren’t bombed,” Mr. Dorodko said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he opposed handing over that eastern Ukrainian region, as Russia has demanded, because, he said, it would only whet the Kremlin’s appetite for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians, Mr. Dorodko said, have little choice but to hang on. He said he saw one upside of losing heat in addition to electricity. His groceries don’t spoil when the refrigerator loses power. He simply puts them on a cold windowsill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Mykhailiuk and Mr. Honcharuk, the couple with the toddler son, kept trying to have a normal life throughout the war. Then came this winter. The apartment was unbearably cold. Ms. Mykhailiuk put on a sweater. She sheathed the baby’s feet in a second pair of socks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People think if a peace deal is near, the situation might be better,” Ms. Mykhailiuk said. “But that is not true. It’s not better. It’s getting worse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15int-thailand-train-01-ljwf-promo/15int-thailand-train-01-ljwf-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little boy was excited to be taking off on a trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had been on a train all Wednesday morning, heading east from the Bangkok suburbs. He had been looking at the scenery through the window and laid his head on the tray table to nap. Then there was a loud boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saitee Katpia, his grandmother, was sitting next to him at a window seat. She said that she lost consciousness briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she came to, she said that it felt like the train car was being crushed. Her head was bleeding. The boy, 6, was on the floor and squeezed in by a chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He kept saying ‘my leg hurts, my leg hurts,’” Ms. Saitee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, she mustered the strength to pull him out and guided him out the train car, which had derailed and had a split carved into it. On her way to safety, she heard a man cry out for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I could not help him,” she said from a hospital bed on Thursday, with at least 10 stitches on her face. “He was a big guy and — me, myself — I had blood dripping on my face.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crane had fallen on the passenger train in northeastern Nakhon Ratchasima Province on Wednesday. At least 32 people were killed and dozens of others were injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 24 hours later on Thursday, another crane collapsed, this time on an expressway in Samut Sakhon Province on the southwestern outskirts of Bangkok, killing at least two people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episodes have raised urgent questions about construction safety in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sites had the same contractor, a firm called Italian-Thai Development. It had already come under scrutiny after the collapse of a building in Bangkok last year that resulted in more than 90 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm said that it would take “full responsibility” for the train accident on Wednesday and “provide full compensation and medical care” to the families of the victims and the injured. It also said it would support the local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its representatives were not reachable on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the tragedy on Wednesday, Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul called for a law to permanently blacklist companies with repeated fatal accidents from bidding on any government projects. One of his deputies, Phipat Ratchakitprakarn, said the government was moving to halt all aboveground construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special Express Train No. 21, a three-car train, was carrying about 200 people between Bangkok and the eastern city of Ubon Ratchathani on Wednesday. On parts of the route, an elevated high-speed railway is being constructed, with funding from Beijing. China envisions the line connecting it with Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thai authorities said that construction operations should not have been running while the passenger train was passing through the area. They said the crane fell on two cars, causing the train to derail and catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of the victims have been identified yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surachart Uintarakari said that his sister and brother-in-law, who were sitting next to each other, were among them. Rescuers found a necklace that their children identified as belonging to their mother, but DNA testing is yet to be completed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The bodies are totally burned,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little after 9 a.m. Wednesday, the train was about halfway through its voyage, passing by Thanon Kot Village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, Penporn Pumjantuek was working at her family’s food stall — whipping up an order of Thai basil stir fry served with steamed rice and a fried egg — when she heard a loud crash and metal screeching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the stall, she saw a mangled passenger train car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Penporn said she helped about 20 passengers come out through a split in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resident, Somjai Duangchang, reached another car that had derailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I broke the glass. The first thing I saw was dead passengers,” Mr. Somjai said. “Chairs squeezed the passengers and people were stuck, squished between chairs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he pushed chairs to free a woman and her baby, eventually helping about a handful of people out of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a few minutes, a fire erupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw some people were still alive but we couldn’t help them,” Ms. Penporn said, adding that they were stuck under pieces of metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Saitee, the grandmother, initially thought the train had crashed. It was only when she squeezed out of the car and was outside did she realize that a crane had fallen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her grandson, she said, suffered shattered bones in his legs and was being treated at a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suchatvee Suwansawat, a former president of the Council of Engineers Thailand, said that the machinery that had collapsed was a launching crane that is used to position girders. He thought the cause was human error, while also questioning the quality of the crane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadly accidents on Wednesday and Thursday were among thousands across Thailand that have killed hundreds of people. The country ranks 13th globally in occupational fatalities, recording 5.3 fatalities per 100,000 workers, according to the International Labor Organization, citing the most recently reported data from 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no independent central body, like the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States, to investigate accidents transparently. So once an accident moves out of the news cycle, the government and the construction companies rarely make any of these findings public. Researchers have found that companies often pay “grease money” to inspectors to overlook safety violations or to fast-track permits without proper engineering audits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surachet Pravinvongvuth, an opposition politician in Parliament, has been an outspoken proponent of Thailand’s need for workplace safety reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There must be due process to pin a charge on those big construction companies, but it won’t be easy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Surachart, who is waiting for DNA testing results for the victims, questioned whether contractors adhered to any safety standards.He added of contractors, “Accidents happen repeatedly but they keep getting hired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sui-Lee Wee and Kittiphum Sringammuang contributed reporting from Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15Iran-protests-01-lckz/15Iran-protests-01-lckz-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran’s judiciary said on Thursday that it had not issued a death sentence for Erfan Soltani, a protester whose execution had been widely reported as imminent and drawn intense international attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments were reported by Iran’s state broadcaster, and were published on social media. President Trump said on Wednesday that he had been told the execution of protesters would not go ahead, and that the killing in Iran had stopped, without offering further details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is good news,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday on social media, citing an unspecified Fox News report that said an unnamed Iranian protester and others would not be sentenced to death. “Hopefully, it will continue!” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran and the region remain on edge, however, after Mr. Trump said in recent days that he would intervene to protect protesters. On Thursday, Iranian state media reported that the airspace over the country had reopened hours after it was restricted for most flights, a move that had fueled fears of a potential U.S.-Iran military confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protester, Mr. Soltani, 26, was sentenced to death just days after he was arrested in early January, his family and human rights groups had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, or IRIB, said on social media that the judiciary had said that Mr. Soltani faced “charges of assembly and collusion against national security and propaganda against the system.” It added that the death penalty does not exist in Iranian law for those offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the charges are confirmed by the prosecutor’s office and a legal verdict is issued by a competent court, the punishment provided for by law will be imprisonment,” the state broadcaster’s post said. Mr. Soltani was being held at the Central Prison of Karaj, west of the capital Tehran, it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday night, Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, denied that Iran intended to execute protesters, calling the claim part of a misinformation campaign by outside elements designed to provoke Mr. Trump into taking action against his country. In an interview on Fox News, Mr. Araghchi added that he had not heard of plans to hang demonstrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than two weeks, the Iranian authorities have mounted a sweeping crackdown on protests, deploying a range of heavy-handed tactics in an effort to suppress some of the largest demonstrations the country’s clerical authoritarian rulers have faced since taking power nearly half a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unrest erupted in late December, when merchants and shopkeepers in Tehran’s markets and bazaars protested in response to the sharp collapse of the Iranian rial, soaring inflation and worsening economic conditions. Iran’s economy has been battered by crippling American and European sanctions and a 12-day war with Israel last year, as well as years of graft and mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protests quickly spread nationwide as demonstrators voiced broader discontent with the government. The authorities imposed an internet blackout, restricting the flow of information and making it difficult to track where protests have been occurring in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has urged protesters to continue demonstrating, and has been exploring how to respond, including possible military strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran’s chief justice, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, said on Thursday that the prosecution of “rioters” — a term officials have used to refer to the protesters — would be carried out swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those elements who were connected to foreign intelligence services and their handlers, and who provided direction to rioters and terrorists either on the ground or from outside, are among the top priorities for prosecution and punishment,” Mr. Mohseni-Ejei was quoted by the state broadcaster as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the U.S. military began evacuating an unspecified number of nonessential personnel from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar because of the rising tensions, according to two American military officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters. Iran fired missiles at the base in June, after the United States attacked its nuclear sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/13/multimedia/00int-diosdado-cabello-02-qpgj/00int-diosdado-cabello-02-qpgj-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a television studio, Venezuela’s feared interior minister would brandish a plastic club and call out the names of government critics — who knew what that usually meant. They could expect government agents to show up and take them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what happened last year to Juan Pablo Guanipa, a prominent opposition politician, after the interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, ripped into him on his weekly show. Mr. Guanipa was arrested, charged with terrorism and treason and sent to prison, where he remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over a decade, Mr. Cabello’s show, “Con el Mazo Dando” (With the Club Striking) is one way, experts say, he has overseen Venezuela’s machinery of repression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the United States raided Venezuela this month and seized its president, Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration called it a law enforcement operation, pointing to a new indictment accusing Mr. Maduro of narco-terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another name prominently featured in the indictment? Mr. Cabello. And like Mr. Maduro, the U.S. government has placed a bounty for his capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Mr. Cabello remains firmly in power, part of interim leader Delcy Rodríguez’s core circle, seen by her side in televised events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with Ms. Rodríguez needing to placate Mr. Trump, one of her biggest challenges could be Mr. Cabello, arguably the second most powerful figure in her government whose fate is now intertwined with the fate of the political movement that has ruled Venezuela for more than two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through allies he controls security services, pro-government militias known as colectivos that are deployed to stamp out dissent and has deep ties to Venezuela’s military. In late 2024, he helped install a cousin to run the country’s secret police, known as the SEBIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cabello and the forces under him are some of the most fervently anti-imperialist members of a movement whose roots are anchored in resisting foreign intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While publicly supporting Ms. Rodríguez, he has also continued condemning the U.S. raid, calling it in one speech a “barbaric, treacherous attack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cabello, in a recent broadcast alongside police commandos, said the country had remained calm following the U.S. attack because of the state’s monopoly on weapons. “We are guarantors of the country’s tranquillity,” he said, a comment that some experts said suggested the strong hand Mr. Cabello wields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a very revealing speech about the role he wants to play, and it’s also a threat about what could happen if people go after him,” said Verónica Zubillaga a Venezuelan sociologist at the University of Illinois Chicago who studies violence in Venezuela. “It’s a warning to be careful, because he can set off waves of extreme violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cabello is widely seen as representing the most opaque and hard-line wing of Chavismo, the political movement founded by Mr. Maduro’s predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chávez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Venezuelan government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said Mr. Cabello was something of a mystery, even within the upper echelons of his government, with no personal ties except with a small number of military officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few Venezuelan officials have more to lose from any weakening of the government’s grip on power: the United States has indicted him for drug trafficking, accused him of running a transnational criminal network and offered a $25 million payment for information leading to his detention. The United Nations and human rights groups have cited him in some of Venezuela’s gravest abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s just as bad a guy as Maduro, if not more,” said Risa Grais-Targow, the Latin America director for Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Venezuelan government did not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Cabello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, Ms. Rodríguez and Mr. Cabello have represented competing strains within Chavismo — she the outward-facing technocrat focused on sanctions relief, he the uncompromising militant. Today they have a shared stake in Chavismo’s survival: she needs him to maintain control of the country and he needs her to safeguard his position in a U.S.-friendly government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cabello, 62, was born in the eastern state of Monagas and, as a teenager, joined an extreme left-wing student group that foreshadowed Chavismo. He later trained as a military officer, graduating in 1987 from the Venezuelan Military Academy and then earning two degrees in engineering. He met Mr. Chávez at the military academy, where they played together on the baseball team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and Mr. Chávez were part of a group of military officers who mounted a failed coup against a democratically elected government in 1992. In the ensuing years Mr. Cabello was a top ally to Mr. Chávez as he built his political movement, helping organize grass-roots organizations and consolidating different factions to create a disciplined political machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Mr. Chávez’s presidency, he became a fixture of power, serving separately as governor, head of the National Assembly, cabinet minister and vice president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zair Mundaray, a former Venezuelan prosecutor who spent 17 years in the Attorney General’s Office and investigated Mr. Cabello, said corruption followed him through every post he held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You could make an encyclopedia of all the crimes Diosdado Cabello has committed,” said Mr. Mundaray, who went into exile in 2017. “If there’s something to steal, he steals it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavismo, a blend of populism, nationalism and state control of key industries, like oil, was founded by Mr. Chávez, who was elected president in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fueled by a prolonged oil boom in the 2000s, the government expanded social programs and reduced poverty, but a drop in oil prices set off an extraordinary economic collapse, a mass exodus and popular discontent. The government’s response was to crush dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cabello has long controlled the system that has sustained the government: arresting, torturing, and disappearing political opponents while hollowing out democratic institutions. Multiple former intelligence agents, detainees, and senior Venezuelan officials told U.N. investigators in a report that Mr. Cabello gave direct orders to the SEBIN intelligence service, including whom to arrest, release, and torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cabello opposed the July 2024 elections, according to analysts, which Mr. Maduro agreed to hold in exchange for partial sanctions relief from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But though tallies collected by the opposition and verified by international observers showed that Mr. Maduro had lost decisively, he declared himself the winner. He would use Mr. Diosdado to help legitimize his authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month after the election Mr. Maduro appointed Mr. Cabello as interior minister — a move widely interpreted as a rebuke to Ms. Rodríguez and her brother Jorge, the president of the National Assembly, who experts said had supported the election, and an acknowledgment that the Maduro government would rely on brute force to maintain power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cabello soon announced the implementation of “Operation Knock Knock,” the deployment of security forces to raid homes and arrest government opponents. In all, the government said it arrested more than 2,000 people for protesting election results, a policing campaign widely denounced by human rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his new post, Mr. Cabello consolidated authority over the intelligence services, the national police, the national guard and the armed civilian groups known as colectivos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mr. Cabello has toned down some of his rhetoric attacking the United States since Mr. Maduro’s capture, experts say he has long opposed any form of liberalization or opening up internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think of him as being from the old school of dictatorship,” said David Smilde, a sociologist who studies violence in Venezuela at Tulane University and lived in the country part-time until last year. “You see your government as like a sweater. If you pull a thread, it all starts coming apart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antonio Marval, a lawyer appointed as a Supreme Court justice several years ago by Venezuela’s legislature, which at the time was controlled by the opposition, recalled how his appointment quickly put him in Mr. Cabello’s cross hairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 17, 2017, Mr. Cabello warned on his show that the new justices named by the legislature, which included Mr. Marval, would be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all know that when a threat is made publicly on Con el Mazo Dando, with the national reach that its host had — and still has — it is accompanied by real actions,” Mr. Marval said. “The message was clear: to silence us, to break us, and to instill fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fled Venezuela shortly afterward, escaping by boat to Curaçao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some critics, Mr. Cabello embodies the ugliest characteristics of Venezuela’s Chavista revolution: a system built not on popular consent, but on fear, violence and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the U.S. wanted to make another point or wanted to do something very decisive,’’ Ms. Grais-Targow said, “I think he would be the most obvious target.”&lt;/p&gt;
