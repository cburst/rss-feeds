&lt;p&gt;The big news in the United States over the weekend was the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old American citizen in Minneapolis by federal agents. Alex Pretti was the second civilian to be killed this month during an aggressive immigration crackdown. Videos show he was restrained when he was shot. Trump administration officials have rushed to smear him as a terrorist. We have the latest coverage of the developing story below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, I spoke with A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times, about threats to press freedom from the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second time this month, federal agents shot and killed a civilian in Minneapolis, and then blocked access to the scene. Here’s the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim, a 37-year-old man named Alex Pretti, was filming on his phone and trying to help a fellow protester on Saturday morning when several agents wrestled him to the ground and restrained him. Then they shot him multiple times. You can watch what happened here. (A warning that it’s disturbing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration claimed that Pretti, a nurse at the city’s veterans hospital, had approached the federal agents with a handgun and the intent to “massacre” them. But eyewitness video footage quickly emerged indicating that Pretti never drew his concealed pistol, and had already been disarmed when he was killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His death prompted large protests across the U.S., and led to a remarkable clash: Federal authorities have blocked state and local investigators from the crime scene. A judge issued a late-night order barring federal officials from destroying evidence, as the Trump administration repeated baseless accusations against the victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretti was a U.S. citizen with no known criminal record who held a legal permit to carry a firearm. Neighbors and colleagues at the hospital described him as passionate and kindhearted. The Minneapolis chief of police, Brian O’Hara, said Pretti had appeared to be “exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity, and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More from Minneapolis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This timeline shows how the shooting unfolded in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague Charles Homans has spent the past 10 days in his native city covering what he calls “the great American unraveling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events like the shooting in Minneapolis, in which eyewitness video and independent reporting contradict the government’s account, only highlight the importance of press freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the F.B.I. searched the home of a Washington Post reporter and seized her phone, laptops and other devices. We’re used to reading about governments going after journalists in places like China, Russia or Turkey. This took place in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job of journalists is to hold the powerful to account on behalf of the public. That job is becoming harder. The economics of journalism have been tough for a couple of decades. But the most immediate threat comes from attacks on press freedom by the U.S. government and the president himself. The New York Times has been the target of multiple lawsuits from President Trump over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to the man who has been leading The Times through this new era: our publisher, A.G. Sulzberger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.G., U.S. press freedom is under attack from the Trump administration. Talk me through its playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First Amendment of the American Constitution offers the press some of the most robust protections in the world. The architects of the Constitution understood that a healthy democracy depends on an informed public, and an informed public depends on a free press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In defiance of that ideal, which has long enjoyed bipartisan support, President Trump has borrowed many of the anti-press tactics used by authoritarian-minded leaders abroad. He has spent years attacking journalists and news organizations. He has sued a number of U.S. news organizations, including The New York Times, and has extracted large financial settlements from some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His administration has aggressively used other levers of power — from access to the Pentagon to regulatory and investigative oversight — to punish news organizations for writing things they don’t like, or reward those willing to parrot administration talking points. Sadly, there is growing evidence that, in response to this pressure, certain news organizations have, at times, self-censored for fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do these attacks compare with past administrations coming after The New York Times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has been far more aggressive in working to undermine the rights and legitimacy of the press than his recent predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But every president has complaints about the people covering their administrations. Kennedy tried to get The Times to reassign our reporter in Vietnam because he was revealing how badly the war was going. Bush warned us that if we exposed his campaign of illegal wiretapping on Americans we’d have blood on our hands. Biden was so incensed with our coverage, including our reporting on questions about his age and fitness, that he became the first president in close to a century not to do a single interview with The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson from all of those examples is clear: We must continue reporting the facts and bringing what we find to the public, regardless of what pressure we might face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Times reporters already do journalism in many countries where press freedoms have been gutted or were never established. Does that help us now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world as a whole has gotten much less hospitable to independent reporting. There are a growing number of places where journalists face arrest or violence for writing pieces that challenge the government. Russia, China and Iran are the most obvious examples. Israel has killed a huge number of Palestinian journalists in Gaza and banned foreign journalists from operating freely there for more than two years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our view is that the story of those places needs to continue to be told, no matter the obstacles. So that means our reporters must work harder to find new ways to keep reporting in the face of limited access, increased surveillance and more fearful sources. And The Times must spend more on legal and security support than ever, nearly 10 times as much as a decade ago. Are those approaches for operating in more hostile environments proving useful in the United States now? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media is very unpopular. Trump is using that. What have we done badly? What could we do better to win back trust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it’s worth remembering that the vast majority of Americans still believe that a free press is important. That said, it is true that journalists will inevitably make mistakes or miss things. But our core commitment is that when we make mistakes we acknowledge them, correct them and learn from them. When we miss things, we go back to the story and dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spend an inordinate amount of time at The Times asking what we could have done differently or better. That instinct toward reflection, transparency and self-correction is to me the most important ingredient in trust. Another is bringing readers a clearer view of how our work happens and why we make certain choices — which we’re trying to do more often with reporter videos and round tables, Times Insider pieces and Q&amp;As like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re under attack, is there a danger that you become part of the polarization? That you are seen as some kind of opposition or resistance? How do you think about navigating this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not anyone’s opposition or resistance — just as we’re not anyone’s supporter or cheerleader. We’re independent. As journalists we have to focus on presenting the fullest, fairest picture of what’s happening and why it matters, and that means tuning out both jeers and cheers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of press organizations have paid Trump huge settlements in weak lawsuits. The New York Times hasn’t. Are there lessons in standing up to Trump?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has filed three lawsuits against us in my tenure, and the only check that has been sent as a result was from the president to The Times: He was ordered to repay our lawyers’ fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your rights will only hold if you exercise them. And retreating in the face of pressure just emboldens future attacks and abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace talks among Russian, Ukrainian and U.S. officials ended on a rare positive note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ferry carrying more than 350 people sank in the southern Philippines early Monday, leaving at least 15 people dead, local officials said. It was not immediately clear how many others were missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M/V Trisha Kerstin 3, a cargo and passenger ship, was carrying 332 passengers and 27 crew members when it sank shortly before 2 a.m. near the island of Baluk-baluk in Basilan Province, the Philippine Coast Guard said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The port management authority of Bangsamoro, an autonomous region that includes a number of islands in the area, said on social media that 15 people had been confirmed dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ferry was sailing from Zamboanga, the country’s third-largest city, to Jolo Island in Sulu Province, a journey of just under 100 miles, the Coast Guard said. It was carrying fewer than the maximum number of passengers allowed, the agency added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is an archipelago made up of over 7,600 islands, most of them uninhabited or sparsely populated, with a total population of over 110 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a developing story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toronto was on its way Sunday to having its snowiest day on record. For a city used to harsh winters, that’s saying a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 10 p.m., Toronto Pearson International Airport had received about 18 inches (46 centimeters) of snow on Sunday, the airport said. Snow was still falling. The most snow Toronto has received in a single day was the 19 inches that fell on Dec. 11, 1944, the Toronto Star newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperatures at the airport dipped to as low as 9 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 13 Celsius) in Toronto, and with gusts reaching nearly 30 miles per hour, the wind chill reached as low as minus 9 Fahrenheit (minus 23 Celsius), according to the Canadian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sunday evening, the city had declared a “major snowstorm condition.” Mayor Olivia Chow said on social media that the peak of the heavy snowfall would end around 11 p.m., and that the city had over 600 snowplows on its roads and sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airport said that around 65 percent of all departures and arrivals had been canceled from Saturday evening through Sunday. It was unclear how many were canceled because of bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Toronto Public Library branches were closed on Sunday, as were some restaurants across the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Toronto schools will be closed on Monday. The Toronto District School Board said that classes and after school programs would be canceled. The Toronto Catholic District School Board said high school exams scheduled for Monday would be rescheduled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/00int-denmark-leader-pfbm/00int-denmark-leader-pfbm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mette Frederiksen has never tolerated bullies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was in high school, Ms. Frederiksen, Denmark’s prime minister, stood up to a pack of skinheads for teasing immigrant kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t go so well. She got socked in the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this week, she ducked a punch, a big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After escalating threats from President Trump about seizing Greenland, Denmark’s gigantic overseas territory, Mr. Trump seems finally to have backed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a speech to the world’s financial elite in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would not use force to take Greenland. Later he said he and NATO leaders had worked out “the framework of a future deal” that would make everyone happy. That remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there were other factors to Mr. Trump’s reversal, like rising congressional opposition and falling stock markets, but there’s no doubt that Ms. Frederiksen’s carefully crafted defense helped block Mr. Trump from getting something he really wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, Ms. Frederiksen has played a nervous game of brinkmanship with Mr. Trump, and it looks like she has won — for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As negotiations continue, Ms. Frederiksen remains locked in an unwanted struggle, trying to calibrate how to make clear to the mercurial Mr. Trump that the answer to his demand that the United States have Greenland is a hard no, without antagonizing him into threatening to snatch it away again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, she has signaled her resistance to one of the compromises that Mr. Trump appeared to be considering — the establishment of American sovereignty over military bases on Greenland. Sovereignty, she insists, remains a “red line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent time with Ms. Frederiksen this fall, in Greenland, where she agreed to a rare sit-down interview in an old house overlooking the sea. We asked her if she felt Mr. Trump was acting like a bully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is able to speak in a very clear way,” she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So am I.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That quiet resolve, rather than flattery, has set her apart from other European leaders when it comes to handling Mr. Trump. It has made her extraordinarily popular at home. Opinion polls in Denmark show her party surging. Elections are later this year and the polls suggest she’s primed to win a third term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her rising support reflects just how much Greenland means for her country, let alone for Mr. Trump and Greenlanders themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Mr. Trump, the island represents the extreme of his imperial ambitions: seizing an enormous land from a NATO ally in what would be the biggest territorial acquisition in American history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 57,000 Greenlanders, a mostly Inuit population with long and complicated ties to Denmark, their future is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for Ms. Frederiksen, who swept into office in 2019 as the youngest prime minister in Danish history, the dispute is undeniably existential, threatening her country’s very identity, composition and stature on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s fast-moving developments demonstrated her tactical skills. After Mr. Trump, declared that since he didn’t win the Nobel Peace Prize he was giving up on peace and would push ahead on Greenland, she rolled up her sleeves, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She imported troops from her own coalition of the willing — including Britain, Germany, France and Iceland — to Greenland. She rallied Europe to speak out in Denmark’s defense. She resisted Mr. Trump’s threats of tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until that moment, many Danes had resigned themselves that there was little their country could do if indeed Mr. Trump moved on the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen’s risky strategy to call in foreign military and law enforcement personnel, albeit a tiny contingent of a few dozen and ostensibly part of an Arctic training exercise, was a signal that any military action that Mr. Trump took “would be very nasty and ugly,” said Bent Winther, a Danish political commentator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her point was that, “if you’re going to take Greenland by force, you’d have to put British and French and German officers in handcuffs,” Mr. Winther said. “I think that was part of the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen’s sparring with Mr. Trump has come to define her leadership. It started from her very first weeks in office in 2019, when she arrived at the age of 41 as the head of the center-left Social Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That summer, during his first term, Mr. Trump suggested that the United States buy Greenland, which has been part of Denmark for more than 300 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen dismissed it as “absurd,” which provoked Mr. Trump to cancel a trip to Copenhagen and call her remarks “nasty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does she regret saying that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a closed chapter,” she said in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Trump reopened that chapter again, on Jan. 7, 2025, even before his inauguration, when he said for the first time that he wouldn’t rule out using military force to get Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same day, the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., made a lightning quick visit to Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, in the depths of winter, ostensibly for business. His appearance drew a band of pro-Trump social media influencers dressed in bulky snowsuits and American flags who passed out $100 bills, which turned off many Greenlanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next week, Ms. Frederiksen held a heated phone call with Mr. Trump. According to European officials who were briefed afterward, Mr. Trump berated her for 45 minutes. She did not want to talk about that one either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A phone call between two colleagues has to be a phone call between two colleagues,” she told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Winther, who co-wrote a biography about her — “Mette F” — in 2019, traces her cool self-assuredness and penchant for underdog causes to her childhood home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father, Flemming Frederiksen, was a typographer, union leader and active member of the Social Democrats. He worked in a newspaper production room as the paper was transitioning into the automated era and stood up for workers about to be rendered obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people ask me: ‘When did you get interested in politics?’ I don’t know what to say,” Ms. Frederiksen said during our interview. “I cannot remember not being interested in politics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was shy, she said, but also strident. After recounting the run-in with the skinhead in high school, she said, “I don’t know if it tells something about my character, maybe it tells us more about his.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first political party she joined was the youth wing of the African National Congress. She rapidly rose through the ranks of the youth wing of the Social Democrats, winning a seat in 2001 to Denmark’s parliament. Mr. Winter said she arrived with “extraordinary confidence, you know, the confidence you can only feel when you are very young.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, she had a different look — casual clothes, spiky hair. She quickly gained a reputation for being a strong public speaker and unafraid of taking on party elders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her tenure has been marked by crisis. During the Covid pandemic her government abruptly ordered a cull of millions of minks (raised for fur), fearful they could spread the virus. It was a controversial decision and resulted in several high-level resignations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She survived the fallout and ultimately was credited with guiding Denmark through those years with relatively low infections while keeping public services as open as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Vladimir V. Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, she called for Europe to act. She was among the first on the continent to commit F-16 fighter jets to the Ukrainian military and boosted weapons production for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her country, like some others, has been the victim of unsolved drone incursions widely believed to have been instigated by Russia, perhaps as payback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On immigration, she has put in place some of Europe’s harshest asylum rules — including utilizing camps abroad and family separations. The moves have been criticized by human rights groups but have sharply reduced arrivals and shored her up politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we spoke with her in September, she was visiting Greenland to apologize for Danish doctors forcing contraception on Greenlandic women and girls, part of a long abusive colonial legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Danish political analysts give her high marks for how she has handled Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s difficult for me to really find any major errors,” said Ulrik Pram Gad, a respected academic on Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Gad said that as Mr. Trump began to get aggressive about Greenland, Ms. Frederiksen did a good job of coordinating with Greenlandic officials and rallying European capitals, such as London and Paris, “trying to get our message out of other people’s mouths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason? Denmark needs Greenland. With it, Denmark is the world’s 12th largest sovereign state. It sits on the Arctic Council, the leading international forum for Arctic affairs. It keeps its special (though now troubled) relationship to the United States, which has been protecting Greenland since World War II and maintains a military base at the northern end of the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When they don’t have Greenland anymore, they will lose 98 percent of their area,” said Pele Broberg, the leader of a Greenlandic political party that has been critical of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So it’s very simple,” Mr. Broberg said. “They’re important as long as they own us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Frederiksen, for her part, has supported Greenland’s autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The future of Greenland belongs to the Greenlandic people,” she said. “It’s more two countries now working together than an old colony, with all what is included in that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 50-minute interview, Ms. Frederiksen was more comfortable talking foreign affairs than about her own life. She is on her second marriage, with a Danish cinematographer, Bo Tengberg, and together they are raising five children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside politics, she finds respite in spending time at the family summer house, cooking and preserving food, and staying fit through spinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said one of her most important guiding principles was keeping Europe’s alliance with America strong — or at least intact. As recently as 2024, she said that she wouldn’t allow “a single piece of paper” to slip between the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past week, she has said that she still believes in a close relationship with the United States, citing “a common interest in ensuring our security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some Europeans have loved the U.S. because of dollars and ‘Dallas’ and so on. That’s not how I am,” she told us. “I really believe that everything would have gone wrong for Europe if it wasn’t for D-Day and for the big role of the U.S. in ending the Second World War.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You saved us,” she said. “And by the way, you have done that again and again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So my starting point is that I will do whatever I can to keep us together in this world, and therefore I’m not starting a conflict,” she said. “I’m trying to solve a conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/25int-venezuela-disappeared-new-54446-cover/25int-venezuela-disappeared-new-54446-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking a 10-hour bus ride across Venezuela in a quest to find her missing husband, Carolina Carrizo fashioned a makeshift bed out of discarded sofa cushions to sleep outside Zona 7, a detention center in Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, she said, about 30 uniformed police officers looking for weapons forced their way inside her home in western Venezuela and took her husband, Omar Torres, 53, a political activist. The authorities never acknowledged the arrest, she said, and she has not heard from him since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has slept outside Zona 7 since arriving in Caracas two weeks ago. She is not even sure that he is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Trump administration’s capture of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, its interim government has drawn international headlines for releasing dozens of political prisoners who rights groups say were wrongfully detained. The trickle of releases has shone a renewed spotlight on a related phenomenon in Venezuela: people who were arrested, largely for political reasons, and then disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s words of praise for what he says is the accommodating attitude of the interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, has made families in Venezuela hopeful that the newfound cooperation between the two countries could bring freedom for dozens of people who were taken without a trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re all here, outside the prisons, because of Trump, because of what he did,” Ms. Carrizo said. “Now I just want my husband back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two weeks, other mothers, wives and girlfriends from across Venezuela have slept on the street outside Zona 7, where their tents sit next to dozens of police officers wielding riot shields. The police claim the jail is empty, but the families say that they have heard screams coming from inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel that Trump is the one who is going to get them out,” said Betsy Orellana, who said her son, Rodolfo José Rodríguez Orellana, a former police officer, is serving a 24-year sentence for participating in a plot to overthrow the government. He has been missing since August, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The locations of at least 66 prisoners are unknown in Venezuela, according to Foro Penal, a leading rights group, which tracks politically motivated detentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those, about 30 of them, like Ms. Orellana’s son, were arrested during an attempted invasion of Venezuela in 2020 known as Operation Gideon. The effort to topple Mr. Maduro, hatched by an American former Green Beret, failed spectacularly: Eight would-be rebels were killed and the rest are still in prison, and have not been heard from since being transferred in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Venezuelan government did not respond to requests for comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forced disappearances is a decades-old practice that became a notorious tool used by Latin American dictatorships against critics — from foreigners to students and political activists. The practice is categorized as a violation of international law and a crime against humanity because the authorities are obligated to acknowledge when a person is in police custody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Venezuela, some people have been missing for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Venezuelan law, detainees are supposed to be brought before a court within 48 hours, a provision that human rights activists say is often ignored. But in the cases of the disappeared, the families do not even know where they are being held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Venezuelan government unleashed a harsh crackdown, called “Operation Knock-Knock,” to stamp out dissent after a July 2024 presidential election that Mr. Maduro claimed to have won despite vote tallies showing he lost decisively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 800 people considered political prisoners are still detained after 154 were released in recent days, according to Foro Penal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in a countries where human rights are frequently violated, the disappearance of inmates is considered particularly serious because the detainees are outside the protection of the law, human rights experts said. It is difficult for families to hire defense lawyers for a case that officially does not exist, making the defendant particularly vulnerable, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International, in a report last year, said Venezuela saw a significant increase in forced disappearances after the 2024 elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People would disappear for hours, days, weeks or months, the organization said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clara del Campo, the South America campaigner for Amnesty International, said families “literally” knock on prison doors asking for their loved ones, but the guards claim no one by that name is in custody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It speaks to the ingenuity of repressive governments whereby they find new ways of applying cruelty and punishing those that they consider real or perceived dissidents,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “desaparecido” became common in the 1970s in Argentina, when a military dictatorship abducted as many as 30,000 people, tortured them and, in hundreds of cases, threw them from airplanes into the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the term was largely considered synonymous with “missing and most likely dead.” In more recent years, the practice became commonplace in countries like Nicaragua, where missing people are believed to be alive but imprisoned, with no records to document it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nicaragua, several dozen people who were detained and missing were recently released, but nine remain unaccounted for, according to a prisoner monitoring group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, Victor Borges, 39, a political activist, has been missing since Nov. 25, relatives said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is as if the earth swallowed him,” said his former partner, Yesley Bello, 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnesses told Ms. Bello that vehicles bearing the insignia of Venezuela’s Bolivarian National Police arrived at Mr. Borges’s workplace, an elite private school, where he cared for animals at the school’s petting zoo, and took him away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His family can rattle off the names of government agencies, prisons, hospitals, police stations and morgues where they have gone to ask about him. Each time, the family said, they were told the same thing: No one by that name was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Bello has begun to consider the possibility that he may never return to her or his five children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will tell them about the great father they had,” she said, her eyes filling with tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martina Rapido, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, said that forced disappearance is “always a strategy to break not only the person who is detained, but also their families, sometimes in retaliation for political opposition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Rapido said the disappearances generally fit one of two patterns. They are often short-term detentions that last a few days. But others involve high-profile activists who are held incommunicado for an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marilis Rodríguez, 58, traveled 200 miles to Caracas recently from the city of Acarigua searching of her son, Carlos José Rodríguez Rodríguez. She said the police took Mr. Rodríguez, 29, from his home on Sept. 23, 2025, after accusing him of illegally selling dollars on the black market, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My son was taken from his house for an investigation,” Ms. Rodríguez said. “They were going to question him about something, and it’s going to be four months since we last heard from him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said her son, a vendor of imported goods, was not politically active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she was told at one prison in Caracas that he had been released, only to be told a day later that it was not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rodríguez’s first child, a boy, was born after he was taken, so they have yet to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family said it had tried to find him in at least five prisons in Caracas and also asked about him at every police station in Acarigua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve turned the town of Acarigua upside down,” said Adriana Graterol, a cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leomaris Prado traveled eight hours by bus from Guárico State to El Helicoide, a prison with a reputation as a center for torture in Caracas, looking for her father. Leonardo Prado, a mechanic, has been missing since Dec. 28, when she said he was stopped at a checkpoint and taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father was not politically active, Ms. Prado said, but had recently gotten into a dispute with noisy neighbors who happened to be police officers, and his family now wonders whether that triggered his detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m here because I want proof that my father is alive,” Ms. Prado said. “I want them to tell me where he is. I want them to tell me why they took him. I want them to show me the evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26int-mexico-shooting-zmgk/26int-mexico-shooting-zmgk-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunmen opened fire on a crowded soccer field in Mexico on Sunday, killing 11 and injuring 12, in an attack that appeared to highlight the persistent violence from the nation’s cartels despite the government’s efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunfire hit people who were socializing after a soccer match, according to local officials, capping a particularly violent period in Salamanca, a city of 275,000 in the central state of Guanajuato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another incident left five people dead in Salamanca on Saturday, and a week earlier, authorities disarmed an explosive device at a state-owned oil facility there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are going through a dark moment, a serious breakdown of our social fabric,” Cesar Prieto, Salamanca’s mayor, said in a video address on Sunday night. “Sadly, criminal groups are trying to subdue the government, something they will never achieve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guanajuato had Mexico’s highest number of murders last year, with 2,035 intentional homicides. That violence has been largely driven by a turf war between a local cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Mexico’s most powerful criminal group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salamanca, in particular, lies near a border that separates territory controlled by each group, and is also home to an important oil refinery. Both cartels want to control Salamanca to aid their drug-trafficking and fuel-theft businesses. Local officials said they were investigating Sunday’s shooting, including whether either cartel was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass shooting is an especially unwelcome development for the Mexican government, which has been carrying out an aggressive campaign against drug cartels in an effort to show the White House that it is serious about stopping the flow of drugs to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has been threatening land strikes against the cartels in Mexico for months, saying the groups run the country. President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico has said repeatedly that a unilateral strike would be a violation of Mexican sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, more specific threats from Mr. Trump, as well as the U.S. capture of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, have heightened fears among Mexican officials that Mexico could be in the crosshairs next. The Trump administration has also been pushing Mexican officials to allow U.S. forces in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Mexico has been eager to hit the cartels harder, hoping it can stave off any U.S. action. In recent days, Mexico announced the capture of several highly sought-after criminals, including a former Canadian Olympic snowboarder who had become a prolific cocaine trafficker. Mexico also transferred 37 accused criminals to the United States last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s efforts have helped lower the number of homicides by more than 20 percent in Mexico compared with a year prior. It has focused much of its firepower on the Sinaloa cartel, a notorious criminal organization based in the nation’s west, and has succeeded in significantly weakening the group. But security experts have said that, at the same time, the Jalisco cartel has strengthened its grip on other parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes Guanajuato. Homicides in the state dropped over the second half of last year, but the fighting between the Jalisco cartel and the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel, a local group, has meant the killing has continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soccer field where the shooting occurred on Sunday is a popular gathering point in the community, with matches drawing large crowds each weekend, said Orlando Arredondo Gallardo, a Salamanca government spokesman. “There are children, there are food stands,” he said. “Everyone attends, especially on Sundays, which is when it’s more family-oriented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12 people injured in the shooting included a woman and a child.&lt;/p&gt;

But Which Ones?</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/asia/taliban-afghanistan-prisoners.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26int-afghanistan-prisoners-01-zbth/26int-afghanistan-prisoners-01-zbth-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, U.S. and Afghan officials have secretly negotiated the release of U.S. detainees — a priority for President Trump and a nonnegotiable prerequisite for any further diplomatic engagement with the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even as at least five U.S. prisoners have been freed from Afghanistan over the past year, talks have stalled over the fate of remaining detainees, according to three people involved in the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While several U.S. prisoners remain in custody, Afghan officials say the release of the last Afghan inmate at Guantánamo Bay rests with the United States and should be part of any further deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guantánamo inmate’s case and the whereabouts of a U.S. citizen in Afghan custody remain a central flashpoint between the Trump administration, which accuses Afghanistan of hostage diplomacy, and a Taliban government that denies those accusations while it seeks recognition from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want these two American detainees to be released, and, at the same time, the fate of our detainee who is in Guantánamo should be made clear,” Zabiullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said in an interview with The Times in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar — the first time Afghan officials are making their demand public. “Our prisoner should be released.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Afghan detainee, Muhammad Rahim, is accused of acting as a courier and interpreter for Osama Bin Laden within Al Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the Taliban have decided to comment publicly on a potential prisoner swap is unclear. But it signals an impasse in negotiations with the Trump administration, which has publicly demanded the release of at least three Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Taliban say they have only two — identified by U.S. officials as Dennis Walter Coyle, an academic held since last January, and Polynesis Jackson, a former U.S. Army soldier whose reasons for being in the country remain murky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afghan officials say they do not know the whereabouts of a third U.S. citizen, Mahmood Habibi, who the F.B.I. says was arrested in Afghanistan in 2022 shortly after the C.I.A. killed Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda’s leader, in Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan’s foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, said no American prisoner was being held for bargaining purposes. “We support finding a solution to this issue as soon as possible,” Mr. Muttaqi said in a subsequent interview with The Times in Kabul. “We never arrest someone to make deals with their country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Muttaqi added, “We want progress in all areas with the United States,” including the reopening of the U.S. embassy in Kabul and strengthened security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States does not formally recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate authority, but U.S. envoys have traveled several times to Afghanistan over the past year to secure the release of American detainees. At least four have already been freed under the second Trump administration, according to the White House — none of them as part of prisoner swaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A participant in the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing release efforts, said the Trump administration would not consider any further public engagement until all remaining U.S. citizens were freed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department declined to discuss the case of Mr. Rahim, but the administration’s position was unequivocal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know the Taliban abducted and detained Mahmood Habibi over three years ago,” a State Department spokesperson said. “The Taliban should immediately release Dennis Coyle, Mahmood Habibi and all Americans detained in Afghanistan and end its practice of hostage diplomacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous administration had offered Mr. Rahim in a prisoner swap that included Mr. Habibi, but the Taliban rejected that offer, American officials say. Instead, the Taliban government freed Ryan Corbett and William Wallace McKenty last January in exchange for Khan Mohammed, a convicted drug dealer who was released from a U.S. federal prison. The Taliban later freed three other Americans — George Glezmann and Faye Hall in March; and Amir Amiry in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior U.S. official added that Mr. Rahim would not be part of any future deal despite the Taliban government’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Habibi’s brother, Ahmad, said officials from the Trump administration had promised him that there would be no deal for Mr. Rahim, the Guantánamo prisoner, until Mr. Habibi was returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have proof the Taliban’s G.D.I. arrested him, so they are only prolonging things by refusing to admit it,” Mr. Habibi said about the General Directorate of Intelligence, Afghanistan’s intelligence agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Afghan intelligence services didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Afghan official with direct knowledge of the negotiations said that the Taliban had released U.S. detainees last year, and the United States had lifted bounties on senior Afghan officials, as part of a framework meant to settle the prisoners’ issue. But recent developments, including the deadly attack on two National Guard troops that U.S. officials say was committed by a 29-year-old Afghan man near the White House in November, had brought the negotiations to a stalemate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Afghan official, speaking on condition of anonymity to comment on the negotiations, said the Taliban would be willing to discuss Mr. Habibi’s fate only after other U.S. detainees and Mr. Rahim had been released. Mr. Habibi was never part of the initial framework agreed upon last year, the official added, but Mr. Rahim was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department lists Mr. Coyle, who is from Colorado, as a wrongful detainee, and his family has taken a more visible role in advocating for his release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circumstances surrounding the detention of Mr. Jackson, like Mr. Habibi’s, are more opaque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, President Trump said in a television interview about Mr. Coyle’s detention by the Taliban, “I’m not happy about them holding anybody, especially if he’s not guilty of anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rahim, the Afghan prisoner, has been held in Guantánamo since 2008 and is the last Afghan citizen there. The United States says Mr. Rahim, now 60, had advanced knowledge of Al Qaeda attacks. He was subjected to “extensive use of the C.I.A’s enhanced-interrogation techniques,” including sleep deprivation that once lasted nearly six days, according to the Senate Committee’s Report on the C.I.A.’s Use of Torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rahim’s family says he did not do anything wrong and has asked the Taliban administration to secure his release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has never been charged with crimes while held in Guantánamo Bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26int-china-general-khjv/26int-china-general-khjv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Gen. Zhang Youxia met with U.S. officials in Beijing in 2024, he exuded the confidence of a man who was seen as the most trusted deputy in the military of China’s top leader, Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang did not appear worried that he had to look over his shoulder to make sure he was pleasing the leader, said Jake Sullivan, who was the U.S. national security adviser attending the meeting, which lasted at least an hour. “He spoke in an unvarnished way that was typical of a military guy, but also reflective of someone who didn’t feel like he had to be cautious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That image of General Zhang’s invulnerability, and closeness to Mr. Xi, shattered over the weekend, when China’s defense ministry announced that he was under investigation for unspecified breaches of laws and political discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang’s downfall is of a different magnitude from the dozens of other generals who have been toppled in Mr. Xi’s unrelenting campaign against perceived corruption and disloyalty over the past three years. His fate has astonished even longtime experts who thought that they had taken full measure of Mr. Xi, China’s most powerful and imperious leader in generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s fair to say this is a seismic event,” Mr. Sullivan said. For Mr. Xi to “take out somebody who he had such a long history with is striking and raises a lot of questions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 75, General Zhang was old enough that Mr. Xi could in theory have ushered him into retirement. Instead, Mr. Xi made a public pariah of him. An editorial about General Zhang in the Liberation Army Daily on Sunday hinted that he was being accused of corruption, and, perhaps more important, of disloyalty to Mr. Xi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang and another commander who fell with him, Gen. Liu Zhenli, had “trampled on” the authority of the military chairman — that is, Mr. Xi — and had “severely undermined the party’s absolute leadership over the military,” the editorial said. Their actions had “rendered massive damage” on the military’s political soundness and combat readiness, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It reads more to suggest that they really were challenging Xi Jinping, that it was really a personal betrayal,” said Shanshan Mei, a political scientist at RAND, a research organization, who studies China’s military. “Corruption is mentioned, but to me this gist of what they are accused of is very political, betraying Xi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What prompted Mr. Xi to finally turn against General Zhang is now a topic of fevered speculation in Beijing and beyond. Some experts believe that Mr. Xi may have come to see General Zhang as too powerful after the general’s own rivals were toppled in previous purges. Others believe Mr. Xi concluded that systemic corruption was so deep that he needed drastic surgery to clear the way for a new generation of commanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other allegations have emerged. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing anonymous sources, that General Zhang has been accused of leaking nuclear secrets to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the investigation has drawn attention to General Zhang’s recent high-level engagements. Mr. Sullivan said their discussions of nuclear issues in 2024 — in the presence of about 20 other Chinese military officers — were strictly general. He said that he brought up nuclear weapons in the context of China’s overall military buildup, but said that General Zhang said nothing sensitive or even substantive on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was not one of the main topics of the discussion,” Mr. Sullivan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Xi and General Zhang are both “princelings,” the sons of revolutionaries who served under Mao Zedong. General Zhang’s father was a general who served alongside Mr. Xi’s father, Xi Zhongxun, in northwest China. There is no evidence that General Zhang and Mr. Xi were close as children, but their shared background might have helped to cement their bond at some point, said Joseph Torigian, the author of a biography of the older Xi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang was a celebrated war veteran in a nation where few active commanders have endured real combat. Mr. Xi kept him in office past retirement, and made him his top vice chairman of the Central Military Commission — Mr. Xi’s eyes and ears in running the People’s Liberation Army’s forces day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if formal charges are leveled against General Zhang, he may face a secret trial in the military justice system. If so, he is almost certain to be convicted and imprisoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang’s downfall “will ultimately have a big effect on the power elite in Beijing because it removes one of their safety boundaries,” said Deng Yuwen, a former editor of a Chinese Communist Party newspaper in Beijing who now lives in the United States. “Even Zhang Youxia’s personal relationship with Xi Jinping was no guarantee of his safety, so nobody can feel safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Zhang joined the army in late 1968 and later distinguished himself as a frontline officer during China’s grinding, yearslong border war with Vietnam from 1979. Accounts from troops described him as an audacious and wily unit leader who urged soldiers to use more artillery during a series of battles for Longshan, a disputed area on the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must first grab him by his throat so that he can’t escape, advance or move, and then we strike,” General Zhang told a junior officer, Li Zhongping, according to a Chinese oral history of the war published in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Mr. Xi became China’s leader in 2012, he quickly moved to shake up the military, which was rife with corruption and organizationally stuck in the past, ill equipped to deal with the country’s expanding naval, air and nuclear weapons ambitions. General Zhang was one of the commanders tapped by Mr. Xi to help lead his overhaul of the People’s Liberation Army, or P.L.A., culminating in a major reorganization from 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Zhang was a key enabler of Xi’s military reform agenda prior to late-2015 — before Xi became powerful enough to impose himself on the P.L.A.,” said James Char, an assistant professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore who studies the Chinese military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, General Zhang, who was then the head of a military region in northeast China, joined a delegation of senior Chinese military officers who visited the United States. Drew Thompson, then a Pentagon official helping to organize the visit, said the general was strikingly confident and inquisitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Chinese officers “stood up faster and straighter when he entered a room,” Mr. Thompson in a post on Substack on Monday. He added: “He wasn’t afraid to talk to foreigners, unlike some other senior officers who were often afraid or unable to engage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that year, he was promoted to head the Chinese military’s armaments department, an office that bought weapons, a post he held until 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department had the makings of “a petri dish of corruption for all the obvious reasons: Developing and procuring expensive weapons systems makes it a nice place to collect bribes and kickbacks,” said Daniel Mattingly, a professor at Yale University who is studying Chinese military politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other senior officers who worked in the department were later felled in anti-corruption investigations. Yet General Zhang had long seemed to be spared scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the purge of General Zhang could raise questions about China’s strategy toward Taiwan and the risks of war. Mr. Thompson, the former Pentagon official, saw the general as someone who “had seen combat and been humbled by it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think he could assess U.S. and Taiwan military capabilities objectively and explain to Xi Jinping what the military risks and costs of an operation to take Taiwan would be,” Mr. Thompson wrote of General Zhang. “I worry about the consequences of someone other than Zhang Youxia providing Xi Jinping with military advice.”&lt;/p&gt;
