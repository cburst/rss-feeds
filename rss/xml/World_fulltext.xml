&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16int-iran-protests-lbpq/16int-iran-protests-lbpq-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A heavy police presence and deadly crackdowns on protesters appeared to have largely suppressed demonstrations in many cities and towns across Iran, according to several witnesses and a human rights group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For weeks, Iran has been convulsed by protests sparked by a collapsing economy and a currency in free fall, with the demonstrations snowballing into a broader antigovernment movement. The authorities have sought to quell the protests with brutal force and have plunged the country into a communications blackout that has made it difficult to know what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four residents reached by The New York Times in the capital, Tehran, said that the streets had mostly been quiet of protests this week as the severity of the crackdown and the high number of casualties became clear. Security forces were deployed in large numbers to nearly every neighborhood, said the residents, who lived in different parts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. They said that it felt as if the capital was under martial law, with the typically bustling and traffic-clogged streets largely empty. Shops and restaurants in some areas were closed after 6 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is massive disappointment and disillusionment,” said another resident, who worked in central Tehran and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been no large-scale protests documented in Iran since Sunday, according to Arina Moradi and Mina Khani, members of the Norway-based Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, which has been monitoring the demonstrations since they began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Moradi said in an interview that a heavy military and security presence remained across many cities and towns, with thousands of people having been detained. She said numerous universities had closed following protests last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Israeli defense assessment found that the scale of protests had noticeably declined since Sunday, following the Iranian forces’ escalating use of live ammunition and the internet blackout, according to two Israeli officials who spoke to the Times on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the numbers continued to drop, they said, several Israeli intelligence officials monitoring Iran had concluded that the current wave of protests had effectively been subdued by the regime. The two officials noted, however, that the Israeli assessment had been complicated by the disruption of internet and telephone services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions across Iran and the region have been high after Mr. Trump recently declared he was prepared to intervene to protect protesters, including potential military strikes against the country, U.S. officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel and several Arab nations have urged President Trump not to strike Iran, a senior U.S. official said. Many Gulf States worry that an attack could destabilize the region and jeopardize their reputations as safe hubs for business and tourism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin said on Friday that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia offered to mediate so as to ensure regional stability after speaking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The situation in the region is extremely tense,” a Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters on Friday, adding that Mr. Putin was trying to facilitate a de-escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent days, the Iranian authorities have stepped back from threats to execute protesters, following international condemnation and the looming possibility of U.S. military action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But regional analysts note that Tehran is drawing a line between ordinary demonstrators and those it labels “rioters” or “terrorists” purportedly backed by foreign powers. Experts say this careful framing is intended to intimidate the population and discourage further protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has been instilling fear into protesters by sending text messages warning families not to let their children go out into the streets. Other messages have urged people to report suspicious activities or encouraged them to attend pro-government rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a screenshot shared by a resident with The New York Times, a text message asserting to be from the intelligence branch of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said it had received more than 400,000 calls to a hotline for reporting “terrorist networks,” and that they had been “identified and dismantled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s violent crackdown has had an especially chilling effect on the protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnesses said security forces had fired on unarmed demonstrators at close range. More than 2,600 people have been killed since protests began, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights group said that more than 3,400 people had been killed and thousands of others injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Mr. Trump said the United States was “locked and loaded” to protect Iranian protesters, whom he later urged to take over government institutions, saying U.S. support was imminent. Since then, Mr. Trump has announced that diplomatic talks with Iran were on, then off, and most recently said Iran had responded to his demands by halting the killing and execution of protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday that President Trump and his team were “closely monitoring the situation” and that “all options remain on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/multimedia/17int-syria-raqqa-ktcm/17int-syria-raqqa-ktcm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syrian government troops advanced into Kurdish-held territory in the north on Saturday, seizing key towns and sparking fresh clashes that threatened to unravel a once-promising political agreement meant to reunify a fractured nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escalation follows intense fighting earlier this month between the government and the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., a Kurdish-led militia that is backed by the United States, and it raises the prospect of a government push toward Raqqa, the largest city administered by Kurdish authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raqqa became globally emblematic of the Syrian conflict after the Islamic State seized it in 2014, and declared it the capital of its self-proclaimed caliphate. The city was devastated during the U.S.-backed campaign to defeat the jihadist group and has since remained under S.D.F. control, with a small American military presence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the fall of the dictator Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, Kurdish-led forces have been hesitant to submit to the new government’s authority. For nearly a year, the two sides have engaged in negotiations over the integration of Kurdish military and civilian institutions into the new Syrian state, but those talks have stalled in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewed fighting has sharpened concerns in Washington about the prospect of a broader confrontation between Kurdish-led forces and Damascus, which could destabilize U.S.-led efforts to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State and endanger American troops still stationed in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military advance on Saturday came hours after Kurdish fighters withdrew from several positions east of the major city of Aleppo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S.D.F. announced the withdrawal after President Ahmed al-Sharaa of Syria issued a decree on Friday affirming the rights of Kurdish Syrians. The announcement was widely seen as an attempt to ease tensions after government forces struck S.D.F. positions in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation quickly deteriorated on Saturday as each side accused the other of violating the terms of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of U.S. military forces in the Middle East, urged Syrian government forces, in a statement on Saturday, to “cease any offensive actions” in areas near Aleppo. The U.S. special envoy to Syria, Thomas J. Barrack Jr., also met in northern Iraq on Saturday with Mazloum Abdi, the S.D.F.’s commander, and Masoud Barzani, the veteran Iraqi Kurdish leader, as Washington worked to avoid a broader confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchanges of fire have been reported in several of towns and villages as government forces said they were advancing through oil-rich areas toward the strategic town of Tabqa, a move that would place government troops roughly 30 miles from Raqqa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewed clashes capped weeks of violence that have amounted to some of the most intense fighting since the end of the civil war in December 2024, when Mr. al-Sharaa’s coalition of rebel groups ousted the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;

Tens of thousands of Iranians have taken to the streets during the latest uprising, including an anti-government protest in Tehran.
]]&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/18/business/davos-world-economic-forum-trump.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 01:00:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Dark History of France’s Embassy in Iraq Goes on Trial in Paris</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/18/world/middleeast/jewish-family-iraq-embassy-.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/world/18int-baghdad-embassy-top/18int-baghdad-embassy-top-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 60 years ago, the French government rented a stately mansion in Baghdad from a Jewish Iraqi family and set up its embassy there. France still uses the building as its embassy, but it has not paid rent to the family in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the family is suing France for $22 million, arguing that the country profited from an Iraqi government campaign of antisemitism. The family says France unilaterally abandoned its contract with it, benefiting from a much cheaper deal offered by the Iraqi government, which expropriated the house under a law that dispossessed Jewish owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezra and Khedouri Lawee — brothers who built the home starting in 1935 on the banks of the Tigris River — believed France, a powerful tenant, would honor its commitments to the family when it occupied the house in 1965, despite any potential threats from the Iraqi authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To save the house, my father leased it to the French,” said Mayer Lawee, 86, the son of Ezra Lawee and one of the last surviving family members who lived in the house. “My father was upset. It’s his home. He built it from scratch and it was taken away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a hearing set for Monday in Paris, the family’s lawyers plan to put French principles on trial, presenting the case through the lens of the country’s avowed commitments to righting its past wrongs. The French government, however, views the matter narrowly, and has argued for dismissal, saying that any culpability lies with Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, involving an unusual blend of contractual and human rights claims, also highlights the plight of about 130,000 Iraqi Jews who from 1941 to 1951 fled or were forced from Iraq, where their ancestors had lived since the biblical “Babylonian Captivity” 2,600 years earlier. The Lawees were among 900,000 Jews who fled or were expelled from Arab and Muslim countries after the founding of Israel in 1948&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family’s lawyers contend the case is analogous to claims made by the descendants of Holocaust victims, who are entitled to restitution from the French government for property stolen during the Nazi era. “The French state’s decision to submit to the antisemitic regulations of a foreign state is unconstitutional, illegal and violates international conventions,” Jean-Pierre Mignard and Imrane Ghermi, lawyers for the family, argued in a complaint filed in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France counters that the damages claimed by the family “are directly caused by decisions adopted by the Iraqi authorities.” But in disavowing all responsibility, President Emmanuel Macron’s government finds itself in the awkward position of relying on discriminatory Iraqi laws in its defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lawee brothers designed the large house with classic columns, curved porticos and expansive rooms, each with his wife and children taking a side, and everyone gathering on the roof or in the garden, Mayer Lawee recalled. But in the late 1940s, amid mounting animosity against Jews over the establishment of Israel, he said, Iraq’s king urged the family to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the family soon settled in Canada, where the brothers built similar homes on neighboring Montreal lots with features deliberately reminiscent of their Baghdad mansion. Still, two relatives remained in the Iraqi house for a decade, then entrusted it to a caretaker until the family’s agent made a deal with France in 1964.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise terms of that agreement, just what happened afterward and which laws apply are in dispute. But it is clear that for six turbulent decades, through the rise and fall of Saddam Hussein and two U.S.-led invasions, France has continued using the house as its official outpost in Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1969, when Iraq claimed ownership of the mansion, France has paid rent to the Iraqi government. The family contends that France at first also kept paying it according to the original deal, but stopped in 1974, and ignored its inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France has argued that Iraqi laws depriving Jews of property, beginning in the 1950s, justified French compliance with the Iraqi authorities. It has also demanded more proof of the family’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Younger members of the family grew up with elders speaking Arabic and waxing nostalgic about homes that they would never see again, that subsequent generations could never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I consider myself Iraqi, and then a Canadian, which is funny since I’ve never been to Iraq,” said Philip Khazzam, 66, a grandson of Ezra Lawee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baghdad house loomed large in family lore, and as his elders aged, Mr. Khazzam grew more interested in what happened. The more he dug, he said, the more he became convinced that France had acted unjustly by profiting from Iraq’s discrimination with no objection or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve only seen pictures of our house. But still, it lives in me every day,” Mr. Khazzam said. “Which is why it matters to me — all the decades later and halfway around the world — much more than an ordinary building ever could. It still is a part of our family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Macron has portrayed France as a leader in restitution efforts as debates about restoring property unjustly acquired through war, totalitarianism or colonialism have swept Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, though, the French have been slow to return looted goods, drawing sharp criticism and recently prompting legal changes to speed the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lawees hope that shifting sentiment and laws will influence the court to take an expansive view of their claim, framing it in this wider context. Still, experts in cultural property law said the family does not have a traditional restitution claim, like Nazi-era looting cases. France tightly circumscribes what qualifies for restitution. The family’s claim, based on one country’s submission to another’s discriminatory policies, seems to fall squarely outside that category, they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evelien Campfens, an art and cultural heritage law lecturer at the University of Amsterdam, said that French restitution measures technically would not apply to the Lawee home because it is outside France. But because the property has an intangible value and precious memories for the family, she said, it may be possible for their lawyers to draw an analogy to the looted property in traditional restitution cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort may be more politically powerful than legally sound, according to Anne-Sophie Nardon, a French cultural property lawyer. “I think the goal is to first make the case public and force the government to speak and enter into negotiations,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But failed talks are what led to court. French officials in 2021 responded to the family’s inquiries after attempts over decades yielded no responses. The family hoped France would exert influence in Iraq to help it reclaim the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, France suggested the family try to re-establish Iraqi citizenship to potentially regain ownership rights, rather than attempt an untested diplomatic process. The family says no Iraqi lawyer would handle its case, and in 2024, it took its claim to a French administrative court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Mr. Khazzam wrote to Mr. Macron, urging France to resolve the matter in mediation. “France does not want to occupy stolen property,” he said. “This is for the dictators and thieves who run failing states.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Macron has not answered. His office did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French president has been outspoken about France’s role in the Holocaust and has pledged to vigilantly fight antisemitism. “In the face of hatred, the republic will always have the last word,” he said in September, responding to a rise in attacks against Jews. “The nation will always be mobilized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet in resisting the Lawees’ call for accountability, the government risks calling that commitment into question, and damaging its reputation, said Ms. Campfens of the University of Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a moral claim,” she said, “and it is embarrassing for the French government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18int-venezuela-economy-jvhk/18int-venezuela-economy-jvhk-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nair Granado rushed to buy groceries as soon as she got her $60 paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knew it wouldn’t be enough to fill the pantry in her home on the eastern fringes of Caracas, Venezuela’s capital. Still, she worried that, before long, her earnings would not be enough to cover even the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prices are rising every day,” said Ms. Granado, 33, a lab receptionist living in a sprawling working-class neighborhood with her two children. “It’s completely out of control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After more than a decade in crisis, Venezuela is no stranger to food shortages, high prices and economic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. military raid that removed Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, has plunged the South American nation into a chaotic new chapter of political and economic uncertainty, setting off a new wave of inflation and currency woes pushing basic grocery items out of the reach of many Venezuelans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Granado, on a recent weekday, could still afford to buy flour and half a carton of eggs. But she did not even dream of buying meat — at more than $9 per pound, the price had nearly doubled in only a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You really have to find ways to be frugal, to make your salary stretch,” Ms. Granado said. “It’s getting harder to buy things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic turmoil is now threatening to deepen a yearslong humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, where more than 70 percent of people already live in poverty, according to a survey by a group of leading universities in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new affordability crisis is hitting Venezuelans especially hard because many have already been living on the edge of hunger for years, said Phil Gunson, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, a research organization, who has lived in Venezuela for over two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’ve sold everything they could, they’ve tightened their belts until there are no more holes left,” Mr. Gunson said. “So there’s nothing left to fall back on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of the sharp rise in food costs is Venezuela’s dependence on the U.S. dollar, widely used in everyday transactions because it is typically less volatile than the country’s own currency, the bolívar. When Venezuela’s economy, once Latin America’s richest, spiraled deeper into crisis in 2019, driven by government mismanagement and exacerbated by U.S. sanctions, many people began to save, spend and charge in U.S. dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, even though the country’s economy is not formally “dollarized,” Venezuelans today rely on U.S. dollars for their daily spending. Vendors often buy from suppliers in dollars, so they peg prices to the currency. And they typically charge higher prices if buyers want to pay in Venezuelan bolívars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New U.S. sanctions over the past year have also forced Venezuela to sell less oil on the global market, which has reduced the volume of dollars circulating in its economy and made the currency more valuable. Now, anxiety about Venezuela’s economic future has sent the value of the dollar soaring, effectively doubling local prices of staples like meat, cheese and milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central Bank of Venezuela sets an official exchange rate, but most people rely on an unofficial rate called the “parallel dollar,” which reflects what dollars actually sell for on the street. This past week, the unofficial value of the dollar peaked at twice the official rate. It has since stabilized, but remains well above the official rate — and grocery store prices have not fallen in step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the incomes of Venezuelans, who are mostly paid in bolívars, “have gone up in smoke” as the value of the bolívar has dropped, said José Guerra, an economist and professor at the Central University of Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So we have a case of an economy that is experiencing extremely high inflation and, at the same time, may be entering an economic recession,” he added, estimating inflation could reach 2,000 percent this year. (The Venezuelan government does not publish official economic statistics and has persecuted economists tracking inflation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela’s minimum monthly wage, eroded by a decade of inflation and not adjusted in years, is now equivalent to roughly 50 cents. The government has tried to plug the gap, in part, by paying public-sector workers bonuses, though these have also diminished in value as the currency continues to wither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are signs the United States is already brokering deals for the sale of Venezuelan oil, which could help stave off an economic disaster in the country and inject critical dollars into its economy. But, in the short term, this potential economic lifeline is a long way from helping ordinary Venezuelans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey by Gallup showed that last year, three in five Venezuelans struggled at times to afford food, among the highest rates in Latin America and the Caribbean. Even among the wealthiest 20 percent of Venezuela’s population, more than half said they were finding it difficult to pay for groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, soup kitchens and other community projects that once fed those in need have also been forced to close, as Mr. Maduro targeted nongovernmental groups with restrictive new rules. The government does deliver basic food baskets to the poor, but this welfare program is plagued by frequent and lengthy delays that can leave families without provisions for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Venezuela’s interim government is focused on its new client-like relationship with the Trump administration, many Venezuelans are simply trying to figure out ways to stretch their dwindling purchasing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johana Paredes, 30, said she was used to rationing the month’s groceries for her family of four. But the new sharp increase in food prices has made it difficult to buy even essential items that were, until recently, within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This past week, we couldn’t do any grocery shopping,” Ms. Paredes said, showing the scant supplies in her tin-roofed home in Los Teques, an hour outside Caracas. “That’s why there aren’t even potatoes,” she added. “Before, we were rich and we didn’t even know it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Caracas, shoppers toured the stalls of the city’s most iconic municipal market hunting for a bargain, as vendors shouted prices in dollars and inflated them in bolívars. Leaning on the counter of the butcher shop where he works, Jesús Balza, 50, said customers were buying less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are only spending on necessities,” he said. “Whoever used to buy a kilo of cheese is now buying half.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was on full display in Valencia, a city in central Venezuela, as shoppers walked out of supermarkets with half-empty bags. Marilsa Mendoza spent her budget of 13,000 bolívars, the equivalent of $35, on only a few necessities: flour, rice, pasta, oil and butter. Until a few weeks ago, she was able to buy far more for the same amount. “Everything is terrible, more or less double the price,” said Ms. Mendoza, 52, a hot dog vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has outlined grand plans to revive Venezuela’s oil industry, vowing to strike a series of deals that would bring American investment into the sector. The main engine of the economy has decayed after years of mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while there are early signs that these plans may be taking shape, it is not yet clear whether this financial lifeline will ultimately materialize and fix Venezuela’s broken economy over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Venezuelans long ago lost faith in their government’s ability to improve their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will whatever oil deals are in the works “actually benefit Venezuela,” asked Mr. Gunson, the analyst. “Only time will tell,” he added. “Right now, all we have is Trump saying that he’s taking the oil and he’s going to sell it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As leaders in Caracas and Washington wrestle over Venezuela’s future, Ms. Paredes said she was holding out hope that real transformation would soon begin to reach people like her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We try to stay positive, believing that things will really change,” she said. “Because honestly, we don’t see any improvement. Everything just keeps getting worse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18int-europe-tariffs-assess-01-gblw/18int-europe-tariffs-assess-01-gblw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a single post on Saturday night, President Trump upended months of progress on trade negotiations with an ultimatum that puts Europe on a crash course with the United States — long its closest ally and suddenly one of its biggest threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Truth Social post, Mr. Trump demanded a deal to buy Greenland, saying that otherwise he would slap tariffs on a group of European nations, first 10 percent in February, then 25 percent in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appeared to leave little room for Europe to maneuver or negotiate in a harsh and combative era of geopolitics. It also left Europe with few options to counter Mr. Trump without repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders are loath to accept the forced takeover of an autonomous territory that is controlled by Denmark, a member of both NATO and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials and outside analysts increasingly argue that Europe will need to respond to Mr. Trump with force, most likely by hitting back on trade. But doing so could come at a heavy cost both to the bloc’s economy and to its security, since Europe remains heavily reliant on the United States for support through NATO and in Russia’s war with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We either fight a trade war, or we’re in a real war,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europeans have spent more than a year insisting that Greenland is not for sale and have constantly repeated that the fate of the massive northern island must be decided by its people and by Denmark. Last week, a group of European nations sent personnel to Greenland for military exercises — a show of solidarity that may have triggered Mr. Trump, since the same nations are the ones to be slapped with tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercises were intended to reinforce Europe’s commitment to policing the Arctic. Mr. Trump has insisted that the United States needs to own Greenland to improve security in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, the exercises were part of an ongoing effort to placate Mr. Trump. For weeks, officials across Europe had dismissed Mr. Trump’s threats to take Greenland, even by military force, as unlikely. Many saw them more as negotiating tactics and hoped that they could satisfy the American president with a willingness to beef up defense and spending on Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Trump’s fixation on owning the island and his escalating rhetoric is crushing European hopes that appeasement and dialogue will work. Facing the reality that a negotiated compromise is less and less likely, Europeans are now racing to figure out how to respond to Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within hours of the post, members of the European Parliament announced that they will freeze the ratification of the trade deal that Mr. Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, struck last summer. And members of European Parliament are openly calling for trade retaliation. Ambassadors from across the 27-nation bloc will gather in Brussels for an emergency meeting at 5 p.m. on Sunday, diplomats said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitting back is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe has a trade weapon specifically created to defend against political coercion quickly and forcefully, and as Mr. Trump’s threats sank in, policymakers argued that this is the time to wield it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool — officially called the “anti-coercion instrument,” unofficially called Europe’s trade “bazooka” — could be used to slap limitations on big American technology companies or other service providers that do large amounts of business on the continent. But using it would sharply ratchet up trans-Atlantic tensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe has spent the past year avoiding such escalation, and for a reason. The continent remains deeply reliant on the United States for NATO protection and for support against Russia in the war on Ukraine, so a full-on trade war could have consequences on other fronts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question is — how far do you want to go?” said Penny Naas, an expert on European public policy at the German Marshall Fund think tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders are still hoping that they might be able to talk things out. Ms. von der Leyen struck an accommodating tone in a social media post on Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the U.S.,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she also warned that tariffs would “risk a dangerous downward spiral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, talks have been all but futile. Foreign policy officials from Denmark and Greenland met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance in Washington last week. Afterward, the Danes and Greenlanders acknowledged that the two sides remained at an impasse, but expressed hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides, they noted, had agreed to set up a high-level working group to work through their issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That optimism was quickly snuffed out when the White House said that the group was meant to work on America’s “acquisition” of Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is just all brute force,” Ms. Naas said. “The president really wants Greenland, and he’s not backing off of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland shows little sign of wanting to be acquired, by money or by military force. Greenlanders have at times chafed at Danish power, but polls and interviews indicate that most don’t want to give up their free education and universal health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Trump takes on a more aggressive posture, European leaders are growing blunter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, wrote on social media on Saturday night that “no intimidation nor threat will influence us.” Ulf Kristersson, the prime minister of Sweden, wrote that “we will not let ourselves be blackmailed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Keir Starmer, the prime minister of Britain — which, like Norway, is not in the European Union, but was listed among the countries that will be slapped with tariffs — called Mr. Trump’s tariff move “completely wrong.” Mr. Starmer has carefully cultivated a positive relationship with the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will of course be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration,” he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18int-israel-board-kzcl/18int-israel-board-kzcl-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s “Board of Peace” is billing itself as a new international peacekeeping body — and permanent membership won’t come cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump is inviting countries to join beyond a three-year term, if they’re willing to cough up more than a billion dollars in cash within the board’s first year, according to a draft of the board’s charter reviewed by The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while the board was conceived as part of Mr. Trump’s plan to oversee Gaza, there is no mention of Gaza in the charter. That omission added to speculation that the group may have a broader mandate to cover other conflicts and could even be aimed at creating a U.S.-dominated alternative to the United Nations Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Security Council resolution adopted in November 2025 endorsed Mr. Trump’s plan for ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and welcomed the establishment of the board as a transitional administration that would set the framework and coordinate funding for Gaza’s redevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enclave was devastated during the two years of war. About 80 percent of the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, according to the United Nations. Many of the roughly 2 million residents are still living in tents among millions of tons of rubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board’s charter was sent out with invitations to potential members over the weekend. A copy reviewed by The Times was verified by an official on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate diplomacy. News of the $1 billion buy-in was previously reported by Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the White House announced the board’s members would include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, and Ajay Banga, the head of the World Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several countries said they had received invitations to join, including Argentina, Canada, Egypt and Turkey. King Abdullah II of Jordan has also been invited, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry announced on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump, who is to chair the board, said in a post on Truth Social last week that it will be “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place,” though much about it remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charter appears to outline a much more ambitious role for the board than the one described in Mr. Trump’s plan for Gaza, published in October 2025, as well as the subsequent Security Council resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board’s mission, according to the charter, is to seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” and “to undertake peace-building functions in accordance with international law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preamble emphasizes the need for what it calls “a more nimble and effective international peace-building body” and laments that “too many approaches to peace-building foster perpetual dependency and institutionalize crisis rather than leading people beyond it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the charter, the board is expected to meet for voting at least annually, and expenses are to be funded through voluntary contributions from member states or other sources. The charter does not elaborate on the peacekeeping efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the “Board of Peace,” the White House on Friday also outlined a “Gaza Executive Board” that would help liaise with a committee of Palestinian technocrats appointed to administer daily life in Gaza. The Gaza executive board includes Ali al-Thawadi, a senior Qatari official, and Hakan Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The composition of the executive board prompted the office of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to issue a rare public protest against the Trump administration, saying it “was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While an Israeli businessman is on the executive board, Israeli government officials have not been named to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miri Regev, an Israeli minister from Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party, told Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, on Saturday that Israel objected to participation of Qatar and Turkey, adding, “Prime Minister Netanyahu will do everything to change that decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between Israel and Turkey have oscillated over the decades, but since the war in Gaza, set off by Hamas’s attack against Israel in October 2023, they have deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has downgraded ties with Israel, repeatedly compared Mr. Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler and praised Hamas, while hosting its officials. Israeli officials are anxious about the prospect of Turkey gaining influence over Gaza’s future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Israel struck Qatar in September 2025 in a failed attempt to kill Hamas leaders meeting there, Mr. Netanyahu defended the action and lashed out against the country for giving what he called “safe haven” to the militant group, even as Qatar was trying to negotiate a cease-fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatari officials have said they hosted Hamas officials at the request of the U.S. government to facilitate channels of communication. Mr. Netanyahu has in the past relied on Qatar to send millions of dollars a month to Gaza, a policy that was intended to keep the peace but that also helped prop up Hamas’s rule over the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel’s priority is seeing Gaza demilitarized. Hamas so far has not agreed to lay down its arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least 16 people have died as ferocious wildfires gripped Southern Chile, burning homes and thousands of hectares of land, the authorities said Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blazes destroyed entire neighborhoods in the southern region of Biobío, according to local authorities, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people to temporary shelters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footage captured expansive flames lashing at buildings, with dense smoke obscuring the horizon under a heavy orange haze. Collapsed buildings and carbonized cars lined the scorched streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am devastated,” said Rodrigo Vera, the mayor of Penco, a city of about 50,000 people, 250 miles South of Santiago, as he described a scene of desperation on Chilean radio on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Vera said that some firefighters were trapped in the fire, and that he had seen others crying on the floor of the command post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 20,000 people had to leave their homes, Mr. Vera said, and emergency crews evacuated patients from a hospital that came under threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor issued an appeal to the national government. “I beg you please from the deepest part of my heart: Come help us,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early hours of Sunday, Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric, declared a “state of catastrophe” for the regions of Ñuble and Biobío. That allowed the government to deploy the army to these areas, where the fires had already affected over 24,000 hectares of land, about 60,000 acres, according to the forestry commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile’s public security minister, Luis Cordero, put the death toll at 16 on Sunday. “There are people who are yet to be located, many of whom may be in shelters,” he said. “The information will be updated progressively as family members report back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile’s national forestry commission said that there are 24 fires actively being fought nationwide, with the majority in the southern forests. The latest surge of fires has been exacerbated by a heat wave in southern Chile, where temperatures were expected to reach 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) today, and winds of up to 55 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile battles wildfires every summer, with most of the fires concentrated over the hottest months, January and February. Last summer, there were 3,018 fires in the country, and this year there have already been 2,825, with the hottest period of the year only beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this summer season, the government announced in November a budget of about $180 million to fight the fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, the deadliest wildfires in Chile’s history ravaged the country’s central coastline, killing 135 people and destroying or damaging 8,188 homes. On that occasion, high winds and prolonged drought contributed to the fires sweeping through the hills and causing widespread devastation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildfires have also gripped the Argentine Patagonia in recent weeks, engulfing nearly 30,000 hectares since mid-December, according to Greenpeace. Though they did not claim any lives, the fires burned through native forests, destroying homes across multiple communities and killing wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Syrian government and a Kurdish-led militia agreed on Sunday to an immediate cease-fire, after weeks of on-and-off clashes, and to a full integration of the militia into the national military forces, according to state media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not the first time that the government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., have reached such a deal. But the 14-point agreement came after two days of significant territorial advances by government forces into areas long held by the S.D.F., which left the force in a significantly weaker negotiating position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, the S.D.F. agreed to hand over the northern province of Raqqa and the eastern province of Deir al Zour. That will leave only one province, northeastern Hasakah, in S.D.F. hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government institutions in a largely autonomous northeastern region dominated by Kurds will also come under the central government’s authority, according to the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will also take control of all the country’s gas and oil fields, nearly all of which have been under S.D.F. control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18int-denmark-mood-02-ptvk-copy/18int-denmark-mood-02-ptvk-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henrik Bager, a Danish soldier who served with Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan, said President Trump’s vow to get Greenland from Denmark and his insults about Denmark’s military were “a punch to the gut.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmus Jarlov, a voluble center-right member of the Danish Parliament and the chairman of its Defense Committee, said that “we know full well that the Americans can destroy us,” but should Mr. Trump, who has not ruled out military force, attack a fellow NATO ally, “of course we will fight back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next breath, Mr. Jarlov said it was “absolutely so weird to be uttering something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casper O. Jensen, a Danish pollster who has lived in the United States and calls it “close to his heart,” sounded like a jilted lover. “I thought we had a really good thing going on,” he said. “Apparently not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are bleak times in Copenhagen, where Danes say they feel betrayed, bewildered and frightened by Mr. Trump’s threats to take over Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish territory and a source of national identity and pride. Greenland, 50 times the size of Denmark, has long made the tiny Nordic nation more of a player on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not small when you add Greenland,” said David Trads, a political commentator and the author of three books on the United States, including his most recent, “America Turns the Clock Back.” “It makes us more important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump’s view is that the United States needs to take over Greenland because Russia and China pose a security threat in the Arctic, and because the island is essential for the “Golden Dome” missile shield he wants to build to protect the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark, NATO allies and most security experts say Mr. Trump already has all the access to Greenland that he needs given existing treaties and the willingness of Denmark, long one of the most pro-American countries in Europe, to do anything — short of giving up Greenland — that the president wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week in Copenhagen, where wall-to-wall television coverage of the crisis seemed to match the mood of the dark Scandinavian winter, Danes pored over every utterance from Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Saturday, thousands of Danes had packed Copenhagen’s City Hall Square before marching to the U.S. Embassy in protest, while hundreds demonstrated in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital. Hours later, Mr. Trump said he was putting new tariffs on Denmark and other European nations until they come to the negotiating table to sell him Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danes have been particularly stunned by Mr. Trump’s taunts that Denmark relies on “two dog sleds” to defend the Arctic island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like fifth graders bullying the small guy in the corner,” said Company Sgt. Maj. Bager, the Danish soldier who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Danes in his unit died during his 2009 deployment to Helmand Province in Afghanistan, he said, and the rhetoric from the White House hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First time you get disappointed, then you get angry, and then you start feeling sad, you know?” he said. “I can’t remember when we haven’t been with you. You asked us to go. We went.” You asked us “to send airplanes, we sent airplanes.” Denmark, he said, “never said no.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Price, the creator of “Borgen,” a Danish TV political drama that became an international hit, set its fourth and final season in Greenland. In episodes that aired in 2022 in the United States, a geopolitical struggle unfolds between the United States, China and Russia after large reserves of oil are discovered on the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Price likes to take real events and push them beyond what has actually happened. But in an interview this past week, he said that had he pitched a story line to Netflix that an American president was vowing to get Greenland from Denmark “one way or another” — the exact words of Mr. Trump — “I would have been laughed out of the pitching room.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They would have said, ‘It’s too much, it is too crazy,’” Mr. Price said in his Copenhagen office, where a large photograph of sled dogs and icebergs in Greenland covers one wall. “I mean, you wouldn’t have an American president that would actually threaten a NATO ally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Danes believe Mr. Trump wants to own Greenland because, as he put it to The New York Times in an interview this month, “that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaja Chemnitz, one of two members of Parliament who represent Greenland, said in an interview that “maybe you should take it up with his therapist if it’s a question of making sure that he feels better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Chemnitz, who said Greenlanders were having trouble sleeping for fear of an American invasion, was host last week to a bipartisan congressional delegation led by Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, to Denmark. In her view, Mr. Trump is more interested in the minerals and oil in Greenland than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sentiment was echoed by Oliver Haagensen, 21, a medical student at Aarhus University, who was skating the other day at an outdoor rink in Copenhagen’s Christianshavn neighborhood. Like everyone else, he was keeping up with the news on Mr. Trump. “He knows that Russia and China want the minerals and oil, and he wants to get there first,” Mr. Haagensen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some short-lived relief in Copenhagen after a meeting on Wednesday in Washington, where Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, emerged from talks with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Mr. Rasmussen said that although a “fundamental disagreement” remained with Mr. Trump and that the American president “has this wish of conquering Greenland,” there would be a “working group” group to continue talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on Thursday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters that the Danes and Greenlanders had agreed “to continue to have technical talks on the acquisition of Greenland,” which Denmark and Greenland said was not the case at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trads, the political commentator, had been skeptical that the meeting would produce anything. On Wednesday over coffee near the Danish Parliament, he said that the only thing that Denmark had on its side against Mr. Trump was time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Danish government hopes that Mr. Trump’s party will lose the midterm elections, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If that doesn’t happen, then we’re just waiting for the three years to pass,” Mr. Trads said. “It’s a long time, but we don’t have anything else. So that’s the whole tactic, just to make sure it goes on and on and on, and somehow he is preoccupied with something else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark colonized Greenland in 1721, and over the centuries, Greenlanders often felt mistreated by the Danes, particularly by a past policy of forcing contraception on young women and girls. In recent decades, the island has moved to home rule. Denmark, which still sends the island of 56,000 people large economic subsidies, now supports its gradual path to independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been tensions along that road, but Mr. Trump has had the effect, Danes said, of pushing the former colonizer and the colonized closer together. “If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark,” Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen of Greenland said last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is extraordinary about Mr. Trump’s involvement, said Martin Breum, an Arctic expert and TV journalist and the author of “Cold Rush: The Astonishing True Story of the New Quest for the Polar North,” are the president’s repeated falsehoods about Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is extreme consternation that your president appears completely immune to data, facts, arguments and common knowledge,” Mr. Breum said. “He continues to state what is obviously, factually wrong. This seems unbelievable to many people in this country. We cannot understand what is happening. We wonder what is next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carsten Jensen, a prominent Danish novelist and the author of “We, The Drowned,” a work of historical fiction about a century of Danish seafaring, said he knew what was next if Europe did not stand together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m 100 percent convinced that Greenland will become American within a short time,” he said gloomily in an interview. “One day, there will be a lot of American military presence in the airport of Nuuk, and that’s it.” NATO will protest, he said, but he predicted it would not end the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“European nations won’t break up NATO because of Greenland,” he said. “It’s too insignificant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a less dark note, Anne Bech, 60, a schoolteacher who was volunteering last Wednesday at Copenhagen’s central library for a session of the Danish tradition of morgensang — communal morning singing — said the theme of songs for the day, about caring for others, had been selected long before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But today it’s even more important,” she said as retirees, students and people on their way to work filed in and picked up songbooks. “We’re very anxious about your president.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next half-hour, a chorus of voices, accompanied by a piano and flute, filled the library’s top floor. The lyrics at the end of Song No. 150 seemed fitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there’s winter darkness at my door&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m empty and sad like never before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show me a way, just a tiny path&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;out of the darkness I’m caught in.&lt;/p&gt;
