&lt;p&gt;While many rewards programs attract high-spending travelers with promises of access and premium status, Bilt came onto the scene in 2021 with a more basic appeal: earning rewards for paying rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions signed on, and now the company is ushering homeowners into its club. Starting Feb. 7, mortgage holders can earn points on their monthly payments. Bilt is also introducing three credit cards and has recently added a rewards currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the most complicated rewards system we’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our personal finance editor has the older Bilt card, and he and Ron are Bilt members. Even so, it took the three of us scores of Slack messages to sort out the details of what Bilt introduced on Wednesday. To top it off, Bilt is taking a page from lawmakers’ playbooks and capping interest rates at 10 percent on new purchases for the first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buzz ahead of the big reveal, which the company previewed in recent weeks, had also prompted speculation. Some tech-savvy Bilt obsessives had managed to dig up the company’s plans — and rumors began flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chatter reached Bilt’s New York headquarters, resulting in one executive’s going on Instagram to try to calm users’ concerns over possible transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loyalty rewards calculations are often mind-numbing, and Bilt’s are about to reach new heights. Ankur Jain, the billionaire founder who raised about $750 million from backers including Blackstone, General Catalyst and the Vanderbilt endowment, talked to us about what’s changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilt made its initial splash by allowing renters to accrue points through their rent payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Bilt is different from the typical credit card rewards program in that it wants to be known as a loyalty and payments platform where you can earn points for everyday spending — even without a Bilt credit card. It also wants local merchants to see it as the most efficient way to micro-target customers on a block-by-block basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After joining as a member, you can earn points through spending at one of Bilt’s 45,000 participating partners, from neighborhood restaurants and gyms to Walgreens and Lyft. Users just need to link an existing credit or debit card, or do other things like connect their Venmo accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have one of Bilt’s credit cards have more opportunities to earn points. More on that in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilt deals in two forms of currency: Bilt points and Bilt cash, which is new. Starting this year, members receive $50 in Bilt cash for every 25,000 Bilt points they earn. Bilt cash comes on top of your points — one does not replace the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And customers can redeem Bilt cash within the platform’s ecosystem; $10 in Bilt cash yields a $10 credit for a Lyft ride, for example, or maybe lunch at a neighborhood restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A maximum of $100 in Bilt cash — which comes with seven pages of fine print — can carry over at the end of each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers can generally earn points on everyday purchases using most non-Bilt-card forms of payment, and they’re largely redeemed for travel and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want to be a commerce platform for where you live, where you get all these benefits in and around your home,” said Mr. Jain, who in 2024 brought in American Express’s former chief Ken Chenault as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the company tried to make the loyalty point conversions simple for travel: 1,000 Bilt points is typically equivalent to 1,000 United Airlines miles, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the changes, renters could rack up points on their monthly rent — one point for every dollar — when they used their Bilt card for five transactions. Plenty of users took advantage, and an inside joke emerged: Renters can buy a bunch of bananas, in five transactions, and meet the minimum threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, Bilt cardholders need to reach a certain amount of spending before they can begin to earn points on housing via the card (up to one point for every $1 of on your monthly rent or mortgage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where it gets complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a Bilt card, you receive 4 percent in Bilt cash back on everyday spend — for every $1 spent, for example, you get 4 cents in Bilt cash. And for every $30 in Bilt cash customers earn, they can redeem it for 1,000 points from their rent or mortgage payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three new cards, one named for a rare metal and another for volcanic glass. All cards earn 4 percent in Bilt cash on everyday spending, carry no foreign exchange fees and come with various sign-up bonuses and other perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilt Palladium. With a $495 annual fee, this premium card will inevitably compete with the likes of Chase Sapphire Reserve and Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilt Obsidian. Cardholders pay a $95 annual fee and receive three points for every dollar spent on groceries (up to $25,000 per year) or dining, as well as two points on travel and one point on all other spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilt Blue. This no-annual-fee card generates one point for every dollar spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly. You can get as much as one point for every dollar of mortgage, rent or monthly condo or other similar maintenance fees, but the money you spend on those things will come out of your bank account quickly. So you won’t pay interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of Bilt as a bill-paying platform in this context, where the housing payment doesn’t count against your available credit on your card. The company is hoping that points-for-mortgage-payments will be enough to pull big spenders into its larger ecosystem — and keep them out of the clutches of rival companies like Chase and American Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has been doing this with rent for a few years, including printing paper checks and sending them to landlords when necessary. But doing business with any start-up has risks. As with any new payment system that you switch to — including long-established ones — it’s prudent to check that your important bills are getting paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, some Citibank customers who signed up for its Strata Elite credit card experienced big problems. A Wall Street Journal report on its troubles is harrowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jain was not dismissive of the idea that people might want to wait to see how Bilt handles its card launch. But he did note that landlords trust Bilt with their payments. And United Wholesale Mortgage doesn’t want people’s monthly payments disappearing into the ether if Bilt’s systems fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If big landlords and mortgage companies trust Bilt to help them collect payments, he said, consumers will probably trust the company with their monthly spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe. Partner merchants pay for a decent fraction of the cost of the Bilt cash. And Bilt makes money from landlords and mortgage issuers, in addition to what it generates from the usual credit-card company revenue sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, loyalty programs generally become less generous over time. Right now, Bilt is in the business of acquiring customers, fast, to try to justify and build on its $10.75 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any card company and minter of loyalty currency, higher annual fees and devalued points in the future are real possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/14/multimedia/14biz-creditcards-2-hglt/14biz-creditcards-2-hglt-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and lenders have been in a tizzy ever since President Trump posted on social media Friday night calling for a one-year 10 percent cap on credit card interest rates. Those fees are a major profit source for card issuers, which for decades have fought legislative attempts to curb them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the president’s call seems to be more of a wish than a mandate: There is no obvious pathway for his administration to unilaterally impose an interest cap, and Congress has shown little interest in heeding his request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank leaders and industry lobbyists are dancing around the topic, trying to avoid publicly disparaging the president’s decree while privately insisting that it would backfire by limiting consumers’ access to credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, banks stocks have been hammered this week, particularly those with large credit card businesses like Capital One; its shares are down 7 percent since Mr. Trump’s post. Citi is down nearly 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If lending is less profitable, banks say, they will be forced to slash credit lines and curb their credit-card offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capping rates is “probably not a great idea,” said Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, which has the nation’s largest share of outstanding balances. “It’ll raise inflation expectations and probably increase rates over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal and financial experts say a federal credit-card interest cap would almost certainly require Congress to act — and so far, there’s no sign that Republican leaders are interested in doing so. Speaker Mike Johnson threw cold water on the president’s plan, saying it could have a “negative effect on a lot of people” because credit card companies may choose to cut off lending to some consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, should the White House make a legislative push, there is some support in Congress on both sides of the aisle. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill last year to cap fees at 10 percent for several years. Without the president’s support, the bill stalled, but it could be revived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts spoke about her economic vision for the Democratic Party. The president called her shortly after and discussed his desire to cap card rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I said, ‘Great, let’s get something done,’” she said Wednesday on CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After calling for rate limits on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump “had not lifted a finger to try to get something through,” Ms. Warren said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump could try to force the issue with an executive order, but that would be quickly met by lawsuits from credit card companies. And the president can’t lean on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal agency that is tasked with protecting consumers but that his administration has largely gutted. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the agency is prohibited from establishing “usury limits” — or interest rate caps — without an act of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit card debt in the United States now exceeds $1.21 trillion, and about 37 percent of American adults carry a credit card balance, according to data from the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average interest rates have been trending up over the past two decades, to 22 percent in November. If those rates were brought down to 10 percent, consumers could save $100 billion a year, or about $899 per person, according to an analysis by researchers at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cap would serve a heavy blow to banks and other credit card lenders’ bottom line, analysts and researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry brought in $160 billion from interest fees in 2024, according to an analysis by the consumer bureau — up more than 50 percent from the $105 billion lenders collected in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s more than financial giants made from other major profit areas like stock trading gains and commissions. Big banks collectively made $133 billion from their market trading in 2023, according to an analysis by two researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One, for example, made $22 billion in interest from its credit card business in 2024. A 10 percent cap would wipe out half of those earnings, estimated Michael Miller, an analyst at Morningstar, a financial services firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The lending model just doesn’t work in terms of mass-market credit cards at a 10 percent cap on interest rates,” Mr. Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks warn that a cap would mean that they would have to cut back on the amount of credit they offered rather than lend money at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, honestly,” Jeremy Barnum, the chief financial officer of JPMorgan, said on the company’s earnings call on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Santomassimo, the chief financial officer for Wells Fargo, offered a similar sentiment to reporters Wednesday morning, saying that “there would be significant negative impact of credit availability for a wide spectrum of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some researchers point out that there are ways for the banks to issue credit cards with lower rates and still make money. In a 2025 analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, researchers concluded that marketing costs were a major factor in driving up rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Credit card banks spend an average of 1 to 2 percent of assets annually on marketing — 10 times the proportion spent by other banks,” the researchers wrote. “The largest credit card banks rank among the world’s top marketers, with budgets comparable to consumer giants like Nike and Coca-Cola.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanderbilt University suggested in an analysis that with a 10 percent cap, lenders could choose to decrease marketing budgets instead of credit lines while still making a profit. In that scenario, a reduction in credit availability would affect only the riskiest borrowers — those with a FICO score of 600 or below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks warn that in an attempt to increase affordability for average Americans, the White House may end up denying credit to households that are struggling financially and push them to alternatives, like payday lenders, that may charge even steeper rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are steeling for a fight should the president try to turn his call into legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five major trade groups put out a public statement last week saying they “share the president’s goal of helping Americans access more affordable credit.” But, the groups said, “evidence shows that a 10 percent interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small-business owners who rely on and value their credit cards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and their lobbyists will continue to fight in public and private, said Erika Najarian, an analyst at UBS. They will warn borrowers that a cap would limit credit availability; privately, she said, they may offer Washington concessions in exchange for dropping the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump said he wanted the cap to take effect on Jan. 20 — the first anniversary of the start of his second term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With less than a week to go until that deadline, no major lender has voluntarily slashed its rates. And with Congress showing no urgency to make legislative moves, industry analysts think the most likely outcome is that the president’s call will go unanswered, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

It Will Take More Than U.S. Cash.</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/15/business/venezuela-oil-history-investment.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/13/multimedia/00-biz-vz-oil-cycle-btpc/00-biz-vz-oil-cycle-btpc-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela appeared to be entering a capitalist golden age in the mid-1990s. The country was opening up its nationalized energy industry, attracting foreign capital and business know-how. “You couldn’t find an apartment in Caracas,” said Ali Moshiri, who worked for Chevron at the time and was frequently in the country to monitor its operations. “It was a gold rush.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in 1998, the price of oil plunged, blowing a hole in the government’s budget. The country’s leaders slashed spending, laying the groundwork for a political backlash and the election of the left-wing populist Hugo Chávez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the audacious U.S. capture of Mr. Chávez’s successor, the dictator Nicolás Maduro, early this month, President Trump painted a rosy economic picture for Venezuela. He promised that tens of billions of dollars of American capital would pour into the country, making Venezuela “very successful,” and said the U.S. intervention was “already making Venezuela rich and safe again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the country’s history shows that foreign capital alone is far from a guarantee of success or stability. Venezuela’s economy has tended to function best when that investment is accompanied by high oil prices — something Mr. Trump has little control over — along with a government that is responsive to popular frustrations over corruption and inequality, issues that appear to be far down Mr. Trump’s priority list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply rebuilding the oil industry without deeper political and economic change is unlikely to transform Venezuela into a country where affluence is widely shared, experts say. Most countries that depend on a natural resource like oil are vulnerable to booms and busts, and it is rare that they gain entry into the club of fully developed economies. But Venezuela has challenges even by those standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a regime which is run mostly by ideology and a great deal of corruption,” said Jeffrey Davidow, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the country in the mid-1990s. “This ain’t Norway building up a great sovereign wealth fund for distribution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationalization is often greeted with horror by businesspeople and economists, but when the oil industry nationalization happened in the mid-1970s, it accompanied what Venezuelans often describe as an economic “bonanza.” With the price of oil soaring amid the embargo and supply shocks of the period, the Venezuelan economy regularly boasted one of the highest growth rates in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The currency was very strong, and as a result of that, imports were cheap,” said Néstor Carbonell, a PepsiCo executive at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was good for American companies like Pepsi. Mr. Carbonell recalled living with his family in a beautiful three-story villa with a lush garden on a cul-de-sac in Caracas. “Most businesses were very prosperous,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So prosperous, in fact, that Venezuelans credited the president who nationalized the oil industry, Carlos Andrés Pérez, with helping to transform their country into “Saudi Venezuela.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all that oil money bloated the state bureaucracy. Corruption flourished, and key sectors of the economy deteriorated. As the government became increasingly dependent on oil revenue, it grew more vulnerable to oil price fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after Mr. Pérez left office in 1979, the price of oil began to drop, and brutal recessions followed. Recalling the bonanza days, Venezuelans returned Mr. Pérez to the presidency a decade later, despite the stench of corruption that had long trailed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, Mr. Pérez shed his populist ways and hired a cabinet full of technocrats. They dialed back price subsidies and sold off state enterprises, as economists had long recommended. They also opened up the oil industry to foreign investment — much the same medicine that Mr. Trump is prescribing today. The business environment improved, attracting people like Mr. Moshiri of Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Latin America is perceived to be booming,” said Bill Mullenix, who oversaw Pepsi’s Venezuela operations between 1996 and 2000, referring to the outlook at the time. “People are talking about how we’re going to have a Major League Baseball team in Caracas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reassured by what they perceived as the government’s improving economic management, many businesses outside the oil industry also began to invest. Pepsi spent well over $100 million building a new plant and distribution network, Mr. Mullenix said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more affluent foreigners arrived, holding forth at glamorous restaurants and hotels, like the Tamanaco InterContinental. “It was like the Fontainebleau in Miami Beach,” said Luis Montoya, a longtime Pepsi board member in Venezuela. “The Tamanaco, that was, in the 1990s, the place to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the improving business climate masked a simmering frustration that periodically boiled over. Riots followed when the government removed subsidies for gas, and there were even attempts by Mr. Chávez and his supporters to overthrow the government by force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government appeared to be more preoccupied with courting foreign investors than defusing domestic unrest. “The cost of living was very high, and there was no social safety net, no social programs,” said José Guerra, an economist who worked at the country’s central bank at the time. “It was a mess.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the price of oil collapsed in 1998 and the government cut spending, it was like a spark that ignited the country’s political system. Venezuelans tended to believe that their country was rich, and that if they weren’t benefiting, it must be because the political elite were stealing from them, said David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane University who lived in the country in the 1990s. Mr. Chávez campaigned to claw back Venezuela’s oil wealth for the people of Venezuela and won the 1998 presidential election handily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least initially, Mr. Chávez’s brand of left-wing populism seemed to work for the economy. Though his presidency was riddled with corruption and inefficiency, the government did distribute the country’s oil revenue far more widely than before. Crucially, the price of oil was rising, and there was far more wealth to go around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You actually start to feel a little bit of momentum,” said Mr. Mullenix, the former Pepsi executive. “From our perspective, there is money on the street.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His colleague Mr. Montoya recalled that Pepsi’s sales volumes under Mr. Chávez in the mid-2000s were around the highest they had ever been in Venezuela, and far higher than any time since. A gleaming Four Seasons hotel opened in Caracas in the early 2000s and seemed to signal another boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the oil curse came for Mr. Chávez as well. By the end of the decade, his economic miracle was undone by falling oil prices and dysfunctional policies. He had replaced technocrats at the state oil company with loyalists and leaned into his disdain for liberal democracy. He had consolidated power by rewriting the country’s Constitution and unilaterally enacting laws, and nationalized foreign oil assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even critics acknowledged that Mr. Chávez had the right idea in at least one respect: the impulse to distribute Venezuela’s oil wealth more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that in this matter Chávez was right,” said Mr. Guerra, who later represented an opposition party in the National Assembly. “People didn’t see that the oil boom benefited the working class and poor people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Trump vows to help revive the Venezuelan economy, the country has experienced more than a decade of wide-scale corruption and extraordinary hardship for the large majority of its population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of oil is not helping. It sits around $60 a barrel, far below where it stood for much of Mr. Chávez’s tenure, and Mr. Trump has indicated that he wants to drive the price lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the United States will control future oil revenue to ensure it benefits the Venezuelan people, and some experts say there is reason to believe it would flow into the national budget and fund the schools and hospitals that the Chávez government erected but let deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others are more skeptical. They say pumping more oil under the current government would primarily benefit the elite, sustaining corruption and doing little to lift up the poor and working class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action Mr. Trump took is to be saluted, said Mr. Carbonell, who later became PepsiCo’s vice president of global government affairs and an author and commentator on Latin American politics, but “not the ultimate solution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would require cultivating a truly democratic government that sought to attend to its citizens’ needs. If the current leadership remains in place, Mr. Carbonell added, “building up the economy will benefit more of those who are in power than those who are part of the population.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15db-armstrong-zfbm/15db-armstrong-zfbm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew here. The crypto world thought it was on the verge of getting the regulatory framework it has so long desired — but the vote was postponed at the last minute. We break down why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also focused on an escalating battle between President Trump and Wall Street over capping credit card interest rates. And make sure to take our quiz today about the wave of millionaires being minted in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin investors are accustomed to market volatility. But what about regulatory uncertainty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a surprise move, Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina and chair of the Senate Banking Committee, postponed a vote scheduled for Thursday on a draft bill that would establish a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the opponents of the bill: Coinbase, the big and politically influential crypto exchange. “After reviewing the Senate Banking draft text over the last 48hrs, Coinbase unfortunately can’t support the bill as written,” Brian Armstrong, the company’s C.E.O., wrote on X, drawing both support and criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recap: The legislation, known as the Clarity Act, would determine regulatory authority over crypto between the S.E.C. to the less-aggressive Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Crypto executives, who have become major political donors, have pushed for significantly lighter oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure once had bipartisan support. But Senate Democrats have pushed for ethics rules limiting U.S. officials from “issuing, endorsing or profiting” from crypto — an attempt to restrict the Trump family’s growing financial ties to the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Armstrong raised his objections. The Coinbase C.E.O. argues that the current version would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;erode the C.F.T.C.’s authority, “making it subservient to the SEC”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;give the government “unlimited access” to investors’ financial records&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“draft amendments that would kill rewards on stablecoins”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of stablecoins, a fast-growing segment of digital finance, has become a major sticking point. Issuers of those tokens, including Circle, want a legal framework that will let them pay interest on those assets, as banks do with many deposit accounts, to attract more customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would also be a big deal for Coinbase, which offers some customers who hold Circle’s USDC token the chance to earn 3.5 percent in “rewards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have stepped up their lobbying efforts in recent days as well. They’ve pushed back on blessing stablecoin rewards programs, which Armstrong suggested was an effort by traditional lenders to “ban their competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s next? Bitcoin was trading around $96,800 this morning, but it has declined from the two-month high it reached on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what the next steps are for the Clarity Act. But Senator Cynthia Lummis, Republican of Wyoming and an avowedly pro-crypto member of the banking committee, bemoaned the bill’s forestalling in a statement. She added that the recent “response from some in the industry proves they just are not ready” for legislation to help the sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump says he has no plan to fire Jay Powell, for now. Trump, when asked by Reuters whether he would seek to remove the Fed chair amid a federal criminal investigation, said, “I don’t have any plan to do that.” But he added, “It’s too soon.” Separately, Stephen Miran, a Fed governor and onetime Trump economic adviser, chided central bankers who defended Powell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley report bumper results. A rise in investment banking revenue helped bolster both Wall Street giants’ bottom lines: Goldman reported $4.38 billion in quarterly profit attributable to shareholders, while Morgan Stanley disclosed $4.4 billion in net income. Both firms also benefited from strong trading results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grok is no longer allowed to digitally undress people. Elon Musk’s xAI said last night that it would no longer let the chatbot create certain sexualized images, after weeks of uproar over users applying the feature to pictures of women and children. Musk said on X that Grok would “refuse to produce anything illegal.” Some advocacy groups have called on Apple and Google to bar Grok and the X social network from their app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders face one of the biggest challenges to their business from Washington in some time, in the form of President Trump’s proposed 10 percent cap on credit card interest rates. Yet their leaders have offered only carefully worded pushback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cautious response underscores the dilemma corporate America faces during the second Trump administration. How can C.E.O.s defend their interests when the president is so active in regulating private enterprise and has taken shots at those who disagree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider what bank executives have said so far about a proposed credit card rate cap, a move that many analysts and academics say could whack a big part of their business:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Santomassimo, the C.F.O. of Wells Fargo, told analysts on Wednesday that he agreed that affordability — a probable driver behind the rate cap idea — was “a real issue.” He added, “We’re very much aligned with trying to find solutions to help as many as we can and just do it in a way that doesn’t have adverse impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane Fraser, the C.E.O. of Citigroup said on Wednesday, “We applaud the president’s focus on affordability.” But she added that “a rate cap is not something that we can support,” adding that such a move would stanch the flow of credit for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Moynihan, the C.E.O. of Bank of America, told analysts on Wednesday, “We believe in affordability. But with instruments that cap, you will see unintended consequences of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None weighed in on the federal criminal investigation into Jay Powell, the Fed chair, a move that economists, former Fed chiefs and others said could imperil the central bank’s political independence, with potentially serious economic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, may have illustrated why not to when he defended the Fed — and got a quick rebuke from Trump. (Darren Woods of Exxon Mobil drew Trump’s ire for a separate matter, after Woods expressed concern about investing in Venezuela.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows the perils of C.E.O.s putting their heads above the parapet, even for powerful leaders like Dimon who have Trump’s ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many C.E.O.s are struggling just to get access to the administration while also seeking to express disagreement over policy, according to The Wall Street Journal. That appears to have influenced an approach of staying largely quiet, at least publicly, per the outlet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some C.E.O. members of the Business Roundtable and the trade group’s leader, Joshua Bolten, last year informally discussed making a statement opposing government equity stakes into companies and government interventionism, according to leaders familiar with the talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the executives ultimately felt speaking out publicly wouldn’t work and that it could be more effective to have private conversations with Trump or other government officials, the leaders said, who added that private discussions with the administration have taken place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re trying other ways as well, Bloomberg notes, including literal golden gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C.E.O.s still have their eyes on the prize, The Journal adds. Bank profits have increased amid major deregulation by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon himself has pitched having JPMorgan lead the I.P.O.s of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the housing giants that the Trump administration has weighed taking public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international community is on tenterhooks over Iran. Protests pose a serious threat to the country’s authoritarian clerical rulers, and some fear that the instability and the government’s crackdown could result in U.S. military action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anxiety can be felt in world markets on Thursday. The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, soared more than 10 percent over the past week, only to plunge on Wednesday and this morning. That’s after President Trump, who has threatened military action, said he had it “on good authority” that Iran appeared to have stopped killing protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this has left traders and political leaders gaming out scenarios, including a disruption of global oil supplies and wider regional instability, Vivienne Walt writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest: It was not entirely clear if Trump’s statement meant Washington has taken a military response off the table. (Allies in the region have been lobbying the administration to choose diplomacy instead.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could unrest in Iran set off a global oil crisis? Iran produces about 3.5 million barrels of oil a day, and sits on the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway through which nearly a quarter of the world’s oil passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader, has vowed to defend Iran. One option traders fear would be trying to close off the Strait of Hormuz to ship traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would be the biggest oil shock in history,” Matt Gertken, the chief geopolitical strategist for BCA Research, told DealBook. He says that Tehran would explore that route “only if the regime believes they are collapsing and have nothing to lose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Iran’s oil exports are completely disrupted, the U.S. could look to regional allies — including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait — to bolster exports. That would be a true test of Trump’s connections with Gulf monarchs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And beyond? Trade experts and shipping companies could also be on high alert for more attacks on cargo ships. Iran-backed Houthi rebels carried out such moves in the Red Sea in recent years, sending shipping prices higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEALBOOK QUIZ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question comes from a recent Times article. Click an answer to see if you’re right. (The link will be free.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all of the talk about an A.I. bubble, the past couple of years have been relatively tepid for Silicon Valley when it comes to high-profile moments of wealth creation. The biggest tech start-ups have mostly stayed private. But that may change in 2026, which could feature a slate of supersize initial public offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX (recently valued at $800 billion) and its artificial intelligence rivals OpenAI (recently valued at $500 billion) and Anthropic (currently in talks to raise money at a value of $350 billion) could all go public this year. Each I.P.O. would mint a small army of new millionaires, especially because A.I. companies pay their employees so handsomely in stock. OpenAI, for example, has already granted $80 billion in vested equity and just set aside another $50 billion for employee stock grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an estimate by the research firm Sacra, how many millionaires could be created if SpaceX, OpenAI and Anthropic all have I.P.O.s this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 7,200&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 16,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 1,700&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 5,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15BIZ-BANK-EARNINGS-fgwj/15BIZ-BANK-EARNINGS-fgwj-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a year, Wall Street’s dominant theme has been the so-called K-shaped economy, in which the well-to-do have powered financial activity despite lower earners’ struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the nation’s largest banks reported a broadly disappointing set of quarterly earnings, marking the first stumble after a yearlong spree of rising markets and softening regulations paid off handsomely for the finance set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results at Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo all fell short of expectations and their shares fell. Troubles ranged from delayed merger deals (JPMorgan) to stubborn expenses (Citi) to questions about the efficacy of artificial intelligence tools (Bank of America). Banks that do business largely with rich individuals and corporations, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, fared comparatively better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from major lenders are closely watched because they contain hints about the state of the economy and ordinary American consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo’s chief executive, Charles Scharf, said his organization had not seen a “meaningful” shift among the customer data it collects, including checking account flows, direct deposit amounts, overdraft activity and payments. Another Wells Fargo executive described “very consistent activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo’s quarterly results disappointed for a different reason: Lower-than-expected profits, in part because mortgage lending stayed weak in a slow housing market. The bank’s stock saw its steepest fall in six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For yet another quarter, Trump administration policies loomed large. This time, the banks were asked by reporters and Wall Street analysts about President Trump’s threatened 10 percent cap on credit card interest rates. Although it’s not clear how or if Mr. Trump could unilaterally impose that ceiling, bankers mostly gave identical responses by arguing that charging lower rates would cause them to lend less to riskier borrowers with patchier credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, was candid about what a cap would mean for the bottom line. “It would obviously be bad for us,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s chief executive, kicked off 2025 by being publicly dressed down by Mr. Trump in a Davos, Switzerland, interview, and the lender’s stock lagged its rivals for much of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Wall Street analysts repeatedly prodded Mr. Moynihan and his chief financial officer during a question-and-answer session about why the bank’s expenses (including head count) remained high despite purported efficiency improvements, as well as its relatively slow pace of growth. Mr. Moynihan eventually conceded in response: “You should expect us to get back on a streak.” Shares dropped anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are not typically seen as on the cutting edge of technology, and Wall Street has been more eager to lend into the A.I. boom than to talk specifics about how it may change their own businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America said its much-promoted “virtual financial assistant,” nicknamed Erica, was used less than before by customers in the fourth quarter. Executives attempted to argue that this was sign that the bank was doing a better job warding off questions before they even needed to be asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs on Thursday said that it was debuting “a new operating model propelled by artificial intelligence.” A bank spokesman said that included creating a more enjoyable experience for the bank’s staff as the technology automated what he described as mundane tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reasons for optimism on Wall Street. Investment bank traders took advantage of strong financial markets to bolster profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rise in mergers and acquisitions, exemplified by the $100 billion bidding war between Netflix and Paramount for Warner Bros. Discovery, is also a boon to Wall Street dealmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for all of this week’s angst, large bank stocks are up strongly over the past 12 months, even after this week’s stumble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major cryptocurrency bill was headed for a committee vote in the Senate on Thursday after months of negotiations, a crucial step in the legislative process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came a social media post from the top executive of Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Coinbase unfortunately can’t support the bill as written,” Brian Armstrong, chief executive of Coinbase, posted on X Wednesday evening. “This version would be materially worse than the current status quo. We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within hours, the Senate vote was canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fate of a hotly contested legislative vote typically hinges on a few key lawmakers who are the moderate voices in a partisan scuffle. But what happened this week to the landmark crypto bill shows how much power Coinbase now wields in Washington, with the crypto industry newly ascendant under President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, congressional staff had worked on the Clarity Act, a nearly 300-page bill designed to establish a regulatory framework for virtually every aspect of crypto, with rules the industry helped write. But at the last minute, Mr. Armstrong objected to proposed language that threatened to outlaw one of Coinbase’s products and said that the bill would assign too much authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the nation’s top financial regulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinbases’s decisive intervention follows years of the company’s work to build a voice in Washington. A publicly traded firm worth nearly $70 billion, Coinbase helped finance a network of PACs that spent more than $130 million to influence congressional races in 2024, aiming to elect pro-crypto legislators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The barrage of political spending sent an unmistakable message to Congress: Anyone who crosses the crypto industry could become a target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the industry’s leading firms have leverage to push for their interests. “Coinbase has played its hand very well,” said Todd Phillips, a finance expert at Georgia State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A representative for Coinbase did not offer a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2012, Coinbase provides a marketplace for people to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. Anyone can log onto the app and make a purchase with a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long ago, though, that the company faced a much tougher landscape in Washington. In 2023, the S.E.C. sued Coinbase for operating as an unregistered exchange, part of the Biden administration’s broad-reaching crackdown on crypto. Mr. Armstrong, who had co-founded the company, attacked the S.E.C. for “regulation by enforcement” and called for more “clarity around crypto rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump’s election in 2024 changed everything. Shortly before taking office, he and his sons started a crypto business, and Mr. Trump proclaimed that he would make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within weeks of Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the S.E.C. dropped its cases against Coinbase and other crypto firms. The industry pushed for legislation that would enshrine that regulatory pullback in law, preventing a future administration from reviving the crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, with the administration’s support, the House passed its version of the Clarity Act, which essentially adopted the crypto industry’s concept for a new regulatory system. The bill would make it much easier for crypto firms like Coinbase to declare that digital currencies are not securities subject to the system of federal oversight designed to protect investors and markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the legislation faced hurdles in the Senate. In the fall, Senate Democrats proposed strict rules on decentralized finance, a branch of the crypto world, prompting outrage in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, banking lobbyists pushed for language to prevent crypto exchanges like Coinbase from paying interest to people who own stablecoins, a type of digital currency designed to maintain a price of $1. They argued that the exchanges would undermine banks by providing a product that competed with traditional deposit accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue soon became a sticking point for Coinbase. A ban on interest could compromise one of its revenue sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way you compete is that you offer these types of incentive programs,” said Kara Calvert, a top policy executive at Coinbase. “It’s absolutely critical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate’s most recent draft of the Clarity Act was unveiled close to midnight on Monday. Congressional staff members and crypto executives rushed to comb through it before the Senate committee meeting scheduled for Thursday, known as a markup, where senators would have a chance to introduce amendments to the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the markup fast approaching, Mr. Armstrong said that he was pulling his support, even as other crypto executives posted messages of support for the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday night, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said the markup would be postponed to an unspecified date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone remains at the table working in good faith,” he said in a statement. “The goal is to deliver clear rules of the road that protect consumers, strengthen our national security and ensure the future of finance is built in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15biz-fannie-ipo-wvbp/15biz-fannie-ipo-wvbp-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be one of most consequential I.P.O.s in years, and President Trump wanted the nation’s biggest investment banks to hash out a plan to sell shares of the government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a major stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, Mr. Trump met with the chiefs of Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs at the White House to discuss the initial public offering. White House officials predicted the stock offering would happen quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But six months later, the deal is still a work in progress. The government has retained a law firm, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, to advise on the deal, but it has not appointed a major Wall Street bank to put together the offering and sell it to institutional investors, said several people briefed on the process who were not authorized to speak publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another critical decision remains outstanding: After any stock offering, will the mortgage firms be freed from government control? Fannie and Freddie were taken over by the federal government during the 2008 financial crisis to prevent their collapse and further disruption to the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the firms have recovered fully from the crisis and no longer require the government’s strict monitoring of their finances, they remain a critical cog in the nation’s $12 trillion mortgage market. Some officials in the Trump administration are wary of anything that could complicate Fannie’s and Freddie’s role in the flow of credit to home buyers, said three other people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie and Freddie buy mortgages from banks and other lenders and package them into bonds sold to institutional investors. By buying bonds from banks, they free up capital for banks to write more loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in an I.P.O. may balk at the notion that the mortgage firms would essentially continue to be run by the White House via the Federal Housing Finance Agency, because what the government deems is best for the mortgage market may not always align with the interests of private shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you should know. The Times makes a careful decision any time it uses an anonymous source. The information the source supplies must be newsworthy and give readers genuine insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing pressure from voters in a midterm election year, Mr. Trump has made boosting housing affordability through lower mortgage rates a top policy goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some housing experts saw last week’s announcement that Mr. Trump had ordered Fannie and Freddie to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds to help drive down mortgage rates as an indication the White House no longer favored ending the government conservatorship anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Fannie and Freddie were freed from federal control, the experts added, Mr. Trump and the White House would not be able to easily direct the so-called government-sponsored entities to buy bonds or take other measures it deemed necessary to make housing more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks like the Trump team is seeing the G.S.E.’s as utilities,” said Jim Parrott, a nonresident fellow at the Urban Institute and an adviser on housing finance issues. “The more the administration comes to view them as instruments of affordability the less likely they will be to give up control of them any time soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Parrott has long called for the federal government treat Fannie and Freddie as quasi-public utilities that can be used to make the mortgage and housing markets more affordable. He has said the Trump administration should not push ahead with a big stock offering for Fannie and Freddie until it decides the future structure of the companies and their role in the mortgage market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Dworkin, president of the National Housing Conference, a coalition of affordable housing providers, said any decision to end the government conservatorship needed to be done in consultation with many industry players, including bankers, homebuilders and investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is essential the approach be transparent,” said Mr. Dworkin, a former Treasury official in the Obama and first Trump administrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said “restoring the American Dream of homeownership after Joe Biden’s affordability disaster was a key campaign pledge for President Trump.” He added that the “administration is looking at every option to continue delivering on this pledge while protecting taxpayers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main proponents of moving swiftly with an offering have been the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and the F.H.F.A. director, Bill Pulte, as well as some longtime investors in shares of Fannie and Freddie, including several hedge funds. But concern about disrupting the mortgage market is one reason the Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, is said to have taken a much more judicious approach to any new stock offering, according to three of the people briefed on the matter. (Mr. Bessent previously said that while he favored ending the government control of Fannie and Freddie he would not do anything that would increase mortgage rates.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bessent may want to keep the status quo and not do a hasty stock offering,” said Wesley Lin, a professor of public policy at U.C.L.A. and a former policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations. “It’s a ‘let’s not rock the boat’ approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate on the traditional 30-year mortgage currently sits at 6.06 percent, down about a percentage point from where it was a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Pulte, who last fall frequently touted the stock offering on social media, has said little about the proposed deal over the past several weeks. But in a statement to The New York Times, Mr. Pulte said Mr. Trump made the right call “to not sell the companies during his first term” and that they were now worth at least $500 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage rates are still relatively high compared to the decade-long low-rate environment that preceded the pandemic. But Mr. Trump and others in the administration have credited some of the recent decline to his directive that Fannie and Freddie begin buying mortgage bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying mortgage bonds, in theory, can help reduce mortgage rates broadly because bond prices tend to move inversely to rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds marketed by Fannie and Freddie are generally considered as safe a bet as investing in Treasuries because the mortgage firms guarantee those securities in the event of default. And the federal government, which chartered both companies decades ago as public-private entities, implicitly has agreed to stand behind those mortgage guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that seemingly risk-free strategy went haywire during the financial crisis and ensuing wave of home foreclosures. Fannie and Freddie got themselves into trouble, in part, by borrowing too much money and investing in bonds backed by high-risk mortgages. To prevent both companies from collapsing, the federal government had to step in and bail them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In return for a taxpayer-funded $187 billion, the Treasury Department took equity stakes in the companies. The bailout ended up being a good deal for the government, as it helped stabilize the mortgage market, and the companies have since paid more than $300 billion in dividends to the Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of a stock offering for Fannie and Freddie believe a sale of some of the government’s remaining equity would both raise tens of billions more for the Treasury and boost the valuation of the government’s remaining shares. It would also generate tens of millions in fees for the Wall Street banks, some of whom have retained the law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis to advise them on establishing the terms for their work on the offering, said three people briefed on the matter. A stock offering also would lead to the companies having their shares re-listed on either the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market, as opposed to the less prestigious over-the-counter market where the stocks have traded for the past 18 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current corporate governance of Fannie and Freddie could pose a problem because Mr. Pulte, who is the firms’ regulator, appointed himself as chair of each of their boards, and named a number of his allies as board members. Both stock exchanges require a majority of board members to be independent and have no material ties to a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Dworkin said a stock offering that “simply establishes a base line value for the government’s stake is not harmful.” But, he added, it has to be “properly structured.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/15biz-data-center-energy-htkv/15biz-data-center-energy-htkv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governors, senators and even some tech executives increasingly agree that the companies behind data centers need to pay more for electricity and to address the strain they are causing on the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is little consensus about how much they ought to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research suggests that the rapid growth of data centers to support the development of artificial intelligence is beginning to drive up electricity costs for residents and small businesses in some places. That has prompted Republicans and Democrats from at least a dozen states — including Florida, Oklahoma, New York and California — to propose legislation and consider other steps to protect residents from higher electricity costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a Democrat, introduced legislation that he said would ensure that technology companies paid their fair share of costs for upgrades to the electric grid that are needed to provide energy to data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Van Hollen’s bill cites recent analysis that indicates that by 2028, the share of all U.S. electricity used by data centers could almost double to as much as 12 percent. That, the senator asserts, will push up electricity prices for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we hope to do is create a national set of rules so that no matter where someone wants to build a data center, consumers know they are not going to get screwed with the costs,” Mr. Van Hollen said in an interview with The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology industry has responded to such proposals in a variety of ways. Executives at some companies like Microsoft have suggested that they are willing to pay more for electricity while others have said that they are already paying their fair share and have opposed efforts aimed at making them cough up more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fundamental problem is the wide disagreement over how the costs of energy and of expanding and running the grid should be divided between individuals, ordinary businesses and large users like data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is most intense in some states, including Mr. Van Hollen’s. Maryland is part of the nation’s largest electricity market known as PJM, which serves all or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia. PJM’s grid has the most data centers in the country, and electricity rates in its states are rising quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Shields, a spokesman for PJM, said the grid manager “is taking up many of these issues in its stakeholder process on large load additions and a decision from the PJM board is forthcoming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that data centers very likely reduced average retail electricity prices in recent years by spreading the fixed grid costs over more customers. But the study’s data ended in 2024, and the authors said it was hard to know whether this trend would continue as energy demand continued to rise sharply. The report noted a large increase in power prices last year in the Mid-Atlantic region linked to the expansion of data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity costs have steadily increased across the country in recent years, with the national average in October up 5 percent from a year earlier, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. A residential customer who used the typical amount of power of 1,000 kilowatt-hours paid about $180, up from $170 a year earlier. Electricity rates in three PJM states — Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia — were up 11 to 16 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to protecting consumers from higher costs, lawmakers are also trying to prevent an increase in blackouts and other grid problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has proposed a “Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights” that would, among other things, allow local governments to prohibit construction of data centers to prevent higher electricity costs and stress on the power system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For its part, the technology industry has worked to compromise with states in some cases while fighting other proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Amazon released a study it commissioned that concluded the tech company had more than covered its costs for power, allowing utilities to reduce rates for other customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced a plan on Tuesday that included promises to “pay our way to ensure our data centers don’t increase your electricity prices.” The plan also commits to minimizing water use and offering jobs and training to local residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no denying that A.I. consumes large amounts of electricity,” Brad Smith, vice chairman and president of Microsoft, said in a blog post. “While advances in technology may someday change this, today, this is the reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump praised Microsoft and said other technology companies would also address the issue. “I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Center Coalition, an industry association, said that the attention from state and federal governments highlighted the importance of the role the technology played in the 21st-century economy and that the tech industry was committed to covering its costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Data centers are committed to being responsible neighbors in the communities where they operate,” Josh Levi, president of the coalition, said in a statement. “The industry remains committed to paying its full cost of service for the energy it uses, and publications from states like Virginia and Arizona confirm we’re delivering on that commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech executives say artificial intelligence will make the economy much more productive. Many of them have also made commitments to use energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases or offset emissions when they do have to use fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some climate and energy experts have expressed concerns that the expansion of data centers is leading to greater use of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

Jacoby, 83, Dies; Brought Legal Services to the Masses</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/15/business/leonard-d-jacoby-dead.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/multimedia/00jacoby-qhmp/00jacoby-qhmp-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leonard D. Jacoby, who as one-half of the law firm Jacoby &amp; Meyers revolutionized the legal world in the 1970s by bringing low-cost services to everyday Americans — and by winning the right to advertise those services on billboards and television — died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 83.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His stepdaughter Lindsey Schank said the death, at a hospital, was from complications of cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jacoby and Stephen Z. Meyers, a friend from law school, started their firm in 1972 out of a single storefront in California’s San Fernando Valley. They wanted to fill a hole in the legal services industry: As they saw it, only the wealthy could afford the fees that most lawyers charged, while the very poor had access to legal aid. Those in the middle were left out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called their new firm a “legal clinic” to differentiate it from a traditional practice. It offered flat fees instead of charging by the hour. Potential clients met first with a paralegal who, if needed, could refer them to a lawyer — a process that kept costs down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacoby &amp; Meyers opened clinics in suburbs and strip malls, close to its client bases, and stayed open late and on the weekends. People came for all sorts of services, including no-fault divorces, wills and personal bankruptcies.&lt;/p&gt;

We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We set out to be the Sears of the legal profession, good value for a reasonable price,” Mr. Jacoby told Los Angeles Business Journal in 1999 — and, in fact, as the firm grew, it put some of its offices in department stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partners innovated in other ways, as well. They allowed clients to pay with credit cards. They created standardized intake forms and managed the information using a centralized database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were also unabashedly populist. In terms that are ubiquitous now, but were remarkable at the time, they promised to represent their clients in the fight against corporate greed and a broken system, a message that resonated during the anti-establishment 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Bar of California banned most forms of advertising, including speaking to the press. Nevertheless, the partners invited reporters to the opening of their first location. After giving a short speech, Mr. Jacoby asked, “Who needs a lawyer?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One man shouted that he did — his car had been repossessed. After a quick consultation and a phone call, they got it back for him, charging all of $15. The story made the evening news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients came flooding in, but the State Bar was not pleased. It moved to censure the partners, who fought back. In 1977, the California Supreme Court — and, in a separate case, the U.S. Supreme Court — ruled that banning legal advertising was unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, Jacoby &amp; Meyers ran its first print ad, in The Los Angeles Times. Within a few weeks, the firm was running ads on television. In Southern California in the late 1970s, the ads were inescapable — the firm was running up to 100 a week, each ending with the slogan “Jacoby &amp; Meyers: It’s about time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1982, Jacoby &amp; Meyers had 43 offices in California and another 18 in New York, and was seeing around 9,000 new clients a month. It was also spending about $1.9 million a year on advertising (about $7 million today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jacoby found that even more than the law itself, he loved promoting it. He wrote the scripts for the TV ads and helped direct them, standing alongside voice actors in the studio to make sure they nailed the delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the pioneering firm in a trend that brought legal services to the masses, Jacoby &amp; Meyers was omnipresent. It was even name-checked in a rap song: “Got more suits than Jacoby &amp; Meyers,” the Beastie Boys sang in “Shadrach” in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such services are taxing, low-margin work, profitable only at a high volume. Yet by the end of the 1980s, thousands of lawyers had flooded into the space that Jacoby &amp; Meyers had carved out, plastering ads for low-cost legal representation on highway billboards and in subway cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1990s, the firm pivoted toward more lucrative areas of consumer law, including personal injury, sexual harassment and class-action suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also reduced the number of its offices and lawyers, and in the process Mr. Jacoby came to believe that Mr. Meyers and another partner, Gail Koff, were trying to push him out. He sued, and the partners settled by effectively splitting the firm in half: Mr. Jacoby took the West Coast, while Mr. Meyers and Ms. Koff took the East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Meyers died in an automobile accident in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leonard David Jacoby was born on March 27, 1942, in Lorain, Ohio, west of Cleveland. When he was 4, his parents, Nathan and Florence (Glasser) Jacoby, moved the family to the San Fernando Valley because Mr. Jacoby, who worked in real estate and giftware sales, had persistent health issues and thought the Southern California climate would do him good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leonard spent two years at the University of California, Berkeley before transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles, from which he graduated with a degree in history in 1964. He received his law degree from U.C.L.A. in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During law school, he grew close to Mr. Meyers, although they lost touch after graduation. Mr. Jacoby was working in private practice when he ran into Mr. Meyers, who was working in legal aid, at a conference in 1972. They founded their firm later that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jacoby’s first marriage, to Barbara Rood, ended in divorce. He married Nancy Platt in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to his stepdaughter, she survives him, along with a daughter from his first marriage, Sharre Jacoby; another stepdaughter, Laurie Arent; a son from an earlier relationship, Tom Nelson; five grandchildren; and a sister, Sandra Klein. Another sister, Daryl Saunders, died in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After splitting with Mr. Meyers, Mr. Jacoby remained involved with the West Coast iteration of the firm, though he eventually sold most of his shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Len was a visionary leader who fundamentally transformed the legal industry for both the profession and the public,” Michael Akiva, a managing partner at the firm, said in a statement. “His commitment to the middle class challenged longstanding barriers and brought quality legal representation to those who previously had nowhere to turn.”&lt;/p&gt;
