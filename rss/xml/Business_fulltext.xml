&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/18montgomery-01-lpqz-print1/18montgomery-01-lpqz-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Montgomery, who founded Cannondale and transformed the cycling industry with bikes built of lightweight aluminum instead of heavier steel, sometimes walked around the company’s headquarters in Connecticut jingling coins in his pocket when the mood needed lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know what that is?” he would say, Murray Washburn, Cannondale’s director of product marketing, recalled in an interview. “That’s change. Change is good. We like change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an overt display of his philosophy of embracing innovation and dismissing the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Montgomery died of complications of a heart-related illness on Jan. 2 at his home in Vero Beach, Fla., his daughter, Lauren Edinger, said. He was 86.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Cannondale, which Mr. Montgomery founded in 1971 with three partners, he and his team of designers and engineers changed the build, weight and feel of upscale, high-tech bicycles. The company was among the first in the United States to mass-produce bikes with frames made of large-diameter aluminum tubes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have a college degree, but I’ve always been a seat-of-the-pants engineer type,” Mr. Montgomery said in 1993 in an interview with The New York Times, which called Cannondale the “Lamborghini of mountain bikes” with shock-absorber systems “that are more sophisticated than some people’s first cars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s oft-told origin story is that Mr. Montgomery spotted a cyclist struggling up a hill in Wilton, Conn., under the weight of a heavy backpack. His idea of lightening the load was to build a trailer, known as the Bugger, that would be towed behind the bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannondale opened its first office in a loft above a pickle factory in Wilton, in Fairfield County. Needing a phone line for the new venture, an employee, Peter Meyers, walked outside to a pay phone and placed an order. When asked what the company was called, Mr. Meyers is said to have peered at the name of a nearby neighborhood train station and said, “Cannondale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, the company continued making biking accessories and apparel, tents and sleeping bags, along with dog beds for L.L. Bean. Then, in 1983, it produced its first bicycle, the ST-500, a touring model that sold for $495 (the equivalent of more than $1,600 today). It featured an oversize aluminum frame that became a Cannondale hallmark — lightweight but stiff, strong and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1993, The Times reported, the company was generating $100 million a year and had 800 employees worldwide. As Cannondale battled top competitors like Specialized, Trek and Giant, the company became known for numerous other innovations, including a single-legged fork, which provided a smooth ride; a carbon-fiber shell integrated with an aluminum spine; and SmartSense, a safety feature that employed lights, sensors and rear-facing radar.&lt;/p&gt;

We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its first mountain bike, produced in 1984, featured a 26-inch front wheel and a 24-inch rear wheel to help the rider roll over rocks and roots. It was dismissed by some critics as cycling’s version of a mullet haircut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by the 1990s, enhanced Cannondale mountain bikes were winning multiple medals at world championships and the Olympics. At the 1999 Tour de France, the Italian sprinter Mario Cipollini won four consecutive stages aboard a Cannondale racing bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also experimented with one-off concepts in the 1990s, like a bike that replaced a traditional front wheel with Rollerblade wheels for maximal aerodynamics. And there was the so-called Pong bike, which was made of aluminum that was cut and shaped by a computerized process and which resembled a futuristic can opener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cannondale started out with a kooky streak, and they never lost it,” Zapata Espinoza, a leading cycling journalist, wrote in an appraisal of Mr. Montgomery, extolling his passion for “trying to be different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990, Cannondale designed a bike that the adventurer Kevin Foster audaciously rode more than 1,500 miles along the Great Wall of China. The prototype had a seat that doubled as a tire pump and featured an automatic transmission that changed gears according to pedal pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It felt like I was putting on a tailored suit,” Mr. Foster posted in an online remembrance of Mr. Montgomery. “I was the engine, the bike, the machine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Stephen Montgomery was born on Dec. 11, 1939, in Coshocton, Ohio, about 110 miles south of Cleveland. His father, Edward Montgomery, was an entrepreneur who developed a process for coating cotton gloves with a rubberized compound. His mother, Frances (Bingenheimer) Montgomery, ran the family fruit farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe, too, was an inveterate tinkerer with bikes and farm equipment. He told The Times that as a boy, he built a small jeep, scavenging the transmission from a junkyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was 12 at the time, Ms. Edinger, his daughter, said in an interview, saying that her father’s ardor for barreling down a hill was overwhelmed one day by his inability to avoid crashing into the front doors of a church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s how he ended up in boarding school,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Montgomery’s devotion to college ended after fits and starts — “He was just not going to do what everybody wanted him to do,” Ms. Edinger said — and, in his 20s, he found a more suitable pursuit in the Caribbean, working on the crews of racing sailboats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sturdiness of the masts gave him an appreciation for the strength-to-weight aspect of aluminum, Ms. Edinger said, as did an accident that reportedly left him and four others clinging to an overturned aluminum hull while waiting to be rescued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After stints in finance and running a bar/restaurant in New York City, Mr. Montgomery founded Cannondale. He reshaped the business with aluminum frames on the suggestion, in a letter, of an engineer, David Graham, who worked for a Connecticut company that built submarines for the Navy; Cannondale promptly hired him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website BikeRadar, to whom Mr. Washburn first told the coin-jingling story, called Mr. Montgomery “one of cycling’s greatest minds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wore jeans and sweatpants; favored conversations over emails; and opened offices in Europe and Japan but kept his manufacturing base in Bedford, Pa., which he visited twice weekly on flights aboard a corporate jet that he piloted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He regularly brought along bike shop owners to the factory to promote the Cannondale brand and make dealers feel like true partners, Dave Cote, a former graphic designer at the company, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would be like taking batting practice at Fenway Park,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannondale eventually became overextended and underfinanced when it ventured into the motocross motorcycle and all-terrain vehicle businesses. In 2003, it filed for bankruptcy. In “a roundabout way,” Mr. Espinoza wrote, it was Mr. Montgomery’s “confidence in himself and his employees that created the motorcycle debacle that lost him his company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is now owned by Pon Holdings, a Dutch conglomerate. Mr. Montgomery later founded a software company to handle billing and medical records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife of 43 years, Celia (Congdon) Montgomery, and their sons Michael, Lucas and John. He is also survived by a son from a previous marriage that ended in divorce, Scott, who was a longtime Cannondale executive; and three grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His father, Scott Montgomery said, “would have rather pushed the envelope on technology, and lead and crash and burn, than to be timid and afraid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/20dc-trump-econ-pmgz/20dc-trump-econ-pmgz-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the chaos along the way, President Trump’s first year back in the White House is ending with an economy that looks, by most conventional measures, much like the one he inherited. Unemployment is low, consumer spending is strong and inflation is stubbornly high but gradually improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariffs, Mr. Trump’s signature economic policy, haven’t set off the manufacturing renaissance he promised, but nor have they caused the surge in inflation that many forecasters feared. The stock market bobbed and weaved its way to a solid if not spectacular 16 percent gain. Analysts who began 2025 warning of the perils of uncertainty ended it by remarking on the U.S. economy’s surprising resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it would be a mistake to think that Mr. Trump’s actions left the economy unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more so than in his first four years in office, Mr. Trump has begun his second term with what amounts to an all-out assault on many of the institutions and policy paradigms that have long been seen by leaders of both major political parties as the foundations of American economic strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has sought to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve, fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an agency that collects key economic data, and cut funding to the universities that conduct much of the country’s cutting-edge scientific research. He has intervened in private business deals, taken stakes in private companies and threatened corporate executives who do not adequately embrace his policy priorities. He has sharply restricted immigration, questioned the value of America’s alliances and imposed punishing tariffs on friends as well as adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of those actions are being challenged in the courts, and future presidents could reverse course on at least some of the current administration’s policies. But economists from across the ideological spectrum warn that Mr. Trump is setting the country on a path that will, in the long run, leave the economy less dynamic, the financial system less stable and Americans less prosperous in the decades ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re weakening the special sauce that made America so great,” said Kimberly A. Clausing, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Clausing worked in the Treasury Department in the Biden administration. But her concerns are shared by many economists on the right, including some who have worked for Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vance Ginn, who served as chief economist in the Office of Management and Budget during Mr. Trump’s first term, praised the administration’s efforts to eliminate regulations and lower corporate taxes. But he said the benefits of those moves are outweighed by the costs of its policies on trade and immigration, its failure to rein in the federal deficit and its intervention in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On net, the policies have been negative for the economy,” Mr. Ginn said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects will most likely be subtle, however, showing up as a steady drip of slower growth and higher interest rates that are hard to detect in the moment. A more acute crisis, if one comes at all, might show up years or decades in the future, much too late for voters to hold Mr. Trump or his administration accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know from a lot of historical experience that the sort of things he’s doing are antithetical to prosperity in the long run,” said Gregory N. Mankiw, a Harvard economist who worked in the White House under President George W. Bush. But, Mr. Mankiw added, it is impossible to know exactly when or where those consequences will be felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More politically salient in the short run may be Mr. Trump’s failure so far to address the widespread economic dissatisfaction that helped him win the 2024 election in the first place. Mr. Trump ran for president on a promise to “end inflation” and even to bring down prices — something that economists at the time dismissed as fantasy but that connected with voters frustrated by years of big price increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once back in office, however, Mr. Trump said little about longstanding cost-of-living issues like housing and child care, and he opposed extending subsidies that made health insurance cheaper for people who buy coverage on federal health care exchanges. Instead, he focused on imposing tariffs, a policy that economists warned would lead to higher prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our economics reporters — based in New York, London, Brussels, Berlin, Hong Kong and Seoul — are digging into every aspect of the tariffs causing global turmoil. They are joined by dozens of reporters writing about the effects on everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the public shared those concerns about tariffs. Consumer sentiment rallied when Mr. Trump won the 2024 election, but cratered during the chaotic early days of his administration. For much of last year, well over half of the people responding to the University of Michigan’s long-running sentiment survey spontaneously brought up tariffs, with most of them saying they expected prices to rise as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, Americans have cited a new concern: the job market. Unemployment has risen only modestly over the past year, but hiring has slowed significantly, and Americans have become increasingly worried about their ability to find a new job if they lose their current one. That has fed into affordability concerns, as Americans, still frustrated by high prices, now also worry about losing their incomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They see young people around them struggling to find a job,” said Joanne Hsu, who directs the Michigan survey. “They see how people who are unemployed and looking for work, they see how long it takes them to find a job. So even though we don’t have mass layoffs, I think it’s unambiguously the case that it is harder to find a job now than it was just a few years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump’s defenders argue that it will take time for his policies to bear fruit. Companies will have to adapt their strategies to a world with higher tariffs and fewer immigrant workers, then build the factories and buy the equipment to put those new plans in place, argued Oren Cass, a longtime critic of free trade who leads American Compass, a populist think tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hiring people to work in your factory is not something that you do within six months of a global economic reset,” Mr. Cass said. “You’re lucky if the company has finished developing its new strategy yet, let alone started putting shovels in the ground on anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few economists share Mr. Cass’s optimism around Mr. Trump’s trade policies. But while tariffs dominated the conversation in 2025, many economists say they are far from the most damaging policies Mr. Trump has embraced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are much more worried about Mr. Trump’s efforts to undermine the Fed’s independence, which, if successful, could make it harder for the central bank to rein in inflation — or, in a potentially even more damaging scenario, cause investors to lose faith in the value of government-issued bonds or the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are worried about yawning budget deficits — a problem that long predates Mr. Trump but that was made worse by the tax-and-spending bill he signed last year. That, too, could cause a fiscal crisis down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are worried that by defunding universities and revoking student visas, the Trump administration will make the United States a less attractive place to do scientific research — robbing the country of an advantage that has helped power its world-leading growth since World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they are worried that by using his powers to attack his enemies and reward his friends, Mr. Trump will erode the system of rules and laws that for decades have made the United States the safest place for investors to bet their money and for entrepreneurs to build their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of those concerns is likely to lead to a recession in 2026. Indeed, most forecasters expect growth to pick up this year. And the U.S. economy still has a wealth of advantages — including the absence of an obvious international alternative — that won’t disappear over night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Ms. Clausing, the U.C.L.A. economist, warned against assuming that just because Mr. Trump’s policies haven’t harmed the economy yet, they never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The long run takes a long time to arrive, and when it comes it comes with astonishing swiftness,” she said. “I don’t know when the chickens come home to roost, but they will.”&lt;/p&gt;

Bid, Seeking to Thwart Paramount</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/business/netflix-warner-bros-discovery-paramount-takeover.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/20biz-netflix-wbd-02-qbcv/20biz-netflix-wbd-02-qbcv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix announced on Tuesday that it had modified its December offer to acquire major parts of Warner Bros. Discovery, a rejoinder to Paramount and its chief executive, David Ellison, who is also in hot pursuit of Warner Bros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Warner Bros. Discovery agreed to sell its streaming and studios business to Netflix in an $83 billion cash-and-stock deal. On Tuesday, Netflix said it would pay that sum exclusively in cash, simplifying the deal for investors who will no longer have to account for Netflix’s fluctuating stock price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today’s revised merger agreement brings us even closer to combining two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world,” David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a statement. Netflix’s modified offer would provide “greater financial certainty” for shareholders, added Ted Sarandos, the co-chief executive of Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move puts pressure on Paramount to further revise its own bid after Warner Bros. Discovery rejected its latest offer, saying it viewed the deal as more risky than Netflix’s. While Paramount has modified the terms of its bid, it has not increased its offer in the weeks since Warner Bros. Discovery chose Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, Hollywood has been on a cliffhanger as Paramount and Netflix duked it out for control of Warner Bros. Discovery, a messy tug-of-war that could help determine the trajectory of the entertainment industry. Paramount mounted a hostile bid for Warner Bros., appealing to the company’s investors after Warner Bros. rejected a series of increasingly sweetened offers in favor of a tie-up with Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle is now being waged among Warner Bros. shareholders, who must ultimately approve any sale, and in the hearts and minds of Hollywood’s besieged creative class, who are already reeling from decades of technological disruption and unending corporate consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. Discovery also said Tuesday that it was making changes to the business it was not selling to Netflix. As part of its planned deal, Warner Bros. Discovery is carving out its cable business, spinning off traditional TV channels like CNN and TNT into a separate publicly traded company. Paramount has questioned the value of that business, arguing it is, in effect, worth nothing. It has argued, in turn, that its proposal to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery is better for shareholders than Netflix’s deal to buy only part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the revised deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will reduce the debt that would have been on its cable business by $260 million. That change is designed to assuage shareholders who feared the cable business’s debt load would reduce investor appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. Discovery also outlined how it valued its cable business, with calculations ranging from $1.33 to $6.86 a share. For shareholders, that purported value would be added to the $27.75 per share value of Netflix’s offer for the rest of Warner Bros. Discovery’s business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By detailing its analysis, Warner Bros. Discovery is trying to offer a road map for investors choosing between Netflix and Paramount, which is offering $108 billion in cash for the whole company, or $30 per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix’s shift to an all-cash offer could hasten how quickly the deal is reviewed by regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which could also expedite a vote on the deal by Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Paramount and Netflix are each trying to convince politicians in Washington — including President Trump — that its offer is better for Americans. Mr. Trump has said that he would be “involved” in the deal, and recently shared an editorial on social media that argued Paramount’s offer was superior. He has also offered praise for Mr. Sarandos of Netflix, calling him “a great person.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s intensifying standoff with European leaders over the fate of Greenland prompted a sharp response from investors Tuesday morning, with the value of U.S. stocks, dollar and government bonds all falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;P 500 dropped over 1 percent as investors reacted to Mr. Trump’s increasing threat of higher tariffs on European allies unless they supported his plans for America to take control of Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning’s decline was the first time the index has started the day that much lower since April amid turmoil from Mr. Trump’s initial sweeping tariff threats on nearly all of America’s trading partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often when stocks are roiled by geopolitical upheaval, investors flock to the safety of other U.S. assets, like the dollar or government bonds. But in a sign that investors were embracing a “sell America” trade and moving away from U.S. assets altogether, both the dollar and U.S. government debt lost value Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar index, which pits the currency against a basket of currencies that represent America’s major trading partners, fell 0.8 percent. The dollar weakened against every currency from the group of 10 nations, which includes the euro, British pound and Norwegian Krone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield, which moves inversely to price, on the 10-year U.S. government note rose, meaning its value declined. This yield acts as one of the most important interest rates in the world by underpinning interest rates across consumer and corporate debt. The 10-year yield rose 0.1 percentage points, to 4.3 percent, its sharpest move higher so far this year, undermining the administration’s efforts to move interest rates lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning’s trading was the first chance U.S. markets had to react to Mr. Trump’s escalating threats toward Europe over the weekend with the U.S. stock market closed on Monday in honor of Martin Luther King’s Birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bright spot in the stock market came from the rising value of defense stocks. Northrop Grumman, an aerospace and defense company, nudged higher Tuesday morning, pushing further into record territory having risen almost 20 percent already this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As co-founder of Sega Enterprises, David Rosen played a leading role in turning video games into a cultural touchstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sega’s games were a direct challenge to Nintendo’s dominance. Among them was Bare Knuckle II, which came to the U.S. as Streets of Rage 2 in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long, Genesis was seemingly everywhere. But Mr. Rosen’s path to video game prominence was circuitous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supported by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He transformed his Japanese photo booth business into a gaming industry game giant that created Mortal Kombat, Sonic the Hedgehog and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Michael S. Rosenwald&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Rosen, a Brooklyn-born entrepreneur who transformed his photo booth business in Japan into Sega Enterprises, the video game giant that dominated arcades, basements and dorm rooms with blockbusters like Mortal Kombat, Sonic the Hedgehog and N.H.L. ’94, died on Dec. 25 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His death was confirmed by Annette van Duren, a spokeswoman for his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a four-decade career that began in the 1950s with coin-operated machines and culminated with the introduction of cutting-edge home gaming systems, Mr. Rosen was a visionary figure who helped shape what is now a $200 billion industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is eminently clear that computer video games are a sign of the times,” he wrote in Play Meter magazine in 1982. “And by that I mean the games are truly one of the early manifestations of an electronic revolution whose technology will personally touch, on an increasing basis, all of our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As chairman of Sega’s U.S. operation in 1989, Mr. Rosen oversaw the introduction of the company’s Genesis gaming console to North America, a product that directly challenged the near-monopoly that Nintendo, its main competitor, had in American homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sega marketed its system to teenagers and young adults who had played Nintendo as children, positioning Genesis as more technologically advanced, with a lineup of grittier, more intense games. In doing so, the company forged the creative and commercial blueprint that turned gaming into a cultural touchstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1990s, Genesis was seemingly everywhere: in commercials during the MTV Video Music Awards; on an episode of “Roseanne,” when the title character’s son, D.J., huffs off to play Genesis at a friend’s house when his parents won’t buy him a Nintendo; and in the 1996 movie “Swingers,” when Trent, played by Vince Vaughn, makes Wayne Gretzky’s head bleed in a popular hockey game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players would greet each other by shouting, “Sega!” parroting the signature ending of the company’s commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everything that Sega was able to do in the ’90s was built on the foundation that Rosen built,” Ken Horowitz, the author of “Playing at the Next Level: A History of American Sega Games” (2016), said in an interview. “The industry would not have become as big a thing as it is today if not for him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rosen took a circuitous path to gaming eminence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1940s, while stationed in Japan with the U.S. Air Force, he became enamored with the country’s culture, especially its art. After his discharge in 1952, he moved to New York and started a business selling portraits by Japanese painters. It wasn’t exactly a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1954, Mr. Rosen moved to Tokyo, where he noticed a booming market in photo identification cards for school and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After learning that shops took about three days to process photos, he thought he could shorten the wait to mere seconds by importing photo booths like the ones he had seen in American amusement parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started a company, Rosen Enterprises, which installed hundreds of the machines around Japan — in movie theaters, restaurants and stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were different times when people would go through school applications and whatnot, and it was not unusual at those times of the year for the lines to get into the booth to be an hour, hour and a half,” he said in an interview with the gaming journalist Steven L. Kent for the book “The Ultimate History of Video Games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1950s, when the typical workweek in Japan shrunk from six or seven days to five and leisure time exploded, Mr. Rosen began thinking of ways to enter the entertainment market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The popular entertainment at that point in time in Japan was pachinko, dance studios, bars and cabarets,” he said in an interview with Next Generation magazine. “None of these were something I wanted to get involved in, so I thought, ‘Gee, coin-operated games.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinball machines, mechanical claws and shooting galleries had become popular arcade games in the United States but were virtually nonexistent in Japan. Mr. Rosen cut deals with U.S. distributors to import older arcade games that were gathering dust in warehouses, then installed them in the same locations as his photo booths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The games, especially the shooting ones, were an immediate hit. Before long, several Japan-based competitors emerged. The biggest was Service Games, a jukebox manufacturer that had transformed into an arcade operator. In 1965, Service Games and Rosen Enterprises merged, becoming Sega Enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly formed company quickly released its own games, beginning with Periscope, a submarine simulator designed by Mr. Rosen, in which players fired projectiles at cardboard ships. The game was a huge hit, and Sega exported it to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1972, Atari released the video game Pong. Sega imported it to Japan. Soon, the company was making its own video games — first for arcades and eventually for its home consoles, starting with the SG-1000 in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Mr. Rosen, gaming represented an entirely new category of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Activities such as television, movies, sporting events and records or the radio all have a valid place in our society, yet all these forms of entertainment lack an important factor in satisfying a fundamental need,” Mr. Rosen wrote in Play Meter. “That need is active participation, which is, of course, what computer video games are all about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Rosen was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 22, 1930, to Samuel and Fay (Sacks) Rosen. His father was an importer and also owned a chocolate factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After joining the Air Force when he was 18, Mr. Rosen was stationed throughout Asia, serving as a writer for Armed Forces Radio. He also worked in the finance office on a military base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He married Masako Fujisaki in 1954. She died last year. His family declined to provide information about his survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rosen stayed with Sega through several mergers. He retired in 1996 as the company was in the early stages of losing battles against Sony, which boasted the PlayStation console, and then Microsoft, with Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sega just didn’t have the financial resources to battle with these bigger companies, which could afford huge losses until their machines became profitable,” Mr. Horowitz said. “Sony and Microsoft just had endless supplies of cash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sega is now part of Sega Sammy Holdings Inc., a Japan-based entertainment conglomerate. In addition to making its own games, the company purchased Rovio, the developer of Angry Birds, in 2023. This year, Sega will celebrate the 35th anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late in his career, Mr. Rosen marveled at how far he’d come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I was a youngster, I went to Coney Island,” he said in “The Ultimate History of Video Games.” “Like everybody else in New York City, I played the games in the penny arcades. That was really my total knowledge of the business.”&lt;/p&gt;
