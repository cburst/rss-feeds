&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/multimedia/25biz-minnesota-ceos-target-fgbv/25biz-minnesota-ceos-target-fgbv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executives of Target, Best Buy, General Mills and Cargill were among more than 60 large Minnesota companies to issue a public letter on Sunday calling for an “immediate de-escalation of tensions” in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter marks the first time the most recognizable businesses in Minnesota have weighed in on the turmoil in Minneapolis amid the aggressive crackdown by federal immigration agents, which have sparked widespread protests throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes one day after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti, a nurse at the city’s Veterans Affairs hospital, while he was being restrained on a Minneapolis sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With yesterday’s tragic news, we are calling for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions,” the letter states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter was signed by top executives of Minnesota’s largest companies and large hospital systems, including Land O’ Lakes, Hormel, U.S. Bancorp, Mayo Clinic and 3M. It also was signed by local sports teams: the Minnesota Vikings, Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Minnesota Wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter is notable because many chief executives have sought to avoid weighing in on any politically charged issues during the second Trump administration. On Friday, hundreds of smaller businesses in the Minneapolis area shut their doors as they backed protests against the actions from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter was shared by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than 6,000 businesses across the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours later, Josh Bolten, the chief executive of the Business Roundtable, an association of more than 200 chief executives of America’s leading companies, said in an emailed statement that he supported the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce’s letter. Beth Ford, the chief executive of Land O’ Lakes, sits on the Business Roundtable’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Sunday, the largest companies in Minnesota had not addressed the issue, but in the Chamber of Commerce letter they said they had been in contact with federal, state and local officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The silence by big companies had been a marked contrast from their responses to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020. That murder helped set off a broader corporate movement to fight racism, with executives making public pledges to support diversity initiatives, donate to social justice causes and express solidarity with demonstrators at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the years since, companies have sought to avoid being caught in any political cross hairs, as the country has become more polarized. Many have said they will be more selective about the issues they tackle, sticking only to those that directly affect their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the World Economic Forum last week, once a hotbed for such social issues, there was hardly any public mention by executives of the unrest in Minnesota. The focus was instead on artificial intelligence, deal making and the reshaping of global alliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for some companies, the violence in Minnesota has hit particularly close to home. After immigration agents detained two employees at the Target store in Richfield, Minn., this month, clergy members gathered at the retailer’s headquarters, asking the company to keep immigration agents off its properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every C.E.O. — and I know all these C.E.O.s — they want to have a peaceful environment for their employees,” said Bill George, the former chief executive of Medtronic, whose current chief signed the letter. Mr. George is also a former board member at Target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The larger issue for C.E.O.s,” he added, is that the unrest in Minneapolis “is going to have a very negative effect on their growth, on their innovation and particularly their ability to recruit people from around the country and around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking as a group, as Minnesota executives did Sunday, could help insulate companies from individual attacks from Mr. Trump, said Jeff Sonnenfeld, a professor of leadership studies at the Yale School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can take down companies individually, but when they work collectively, they have immunity,” Mr. Sonnenfeld said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives similarly relied on the law of numbers in expressing concerns about tariffs, which organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce came out in opposition to last spring. Many companies ultimately struck their own deals with the administration over tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday’s letter stopped short of calling for specific action nor did the corporations condemn the shooting of Mr. Pretti by the federal agents or call for immigration authorities to rein in their aggressive enforcement. The statement also did not call on protesters to change their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With polls showing voters split along party lines on whether they support President Trump’s immigration crackdown, corporations have been careful not to alienate large numbers of their customers by taking a side. They also risk angering Mr. Trump, who has publicly rebuked companies and executives he believes have crossed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter from the Minnesota companies on Sunday struck a neutral tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused cooperation among local, state and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution that enables families, businesses, our employees, and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future,” the executives wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor of business and society at the N.Y.U. Stern business school, said she thought the companies had no choice but to say something. “They have been backed into a corner, because obviously the situation going on is starting to have commercial consequences,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Taylor added: “Is it better than doing nothing? Probably. Is it sufficient? I don’t think anyone’s going to think this is sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/00biz-goodwill-qzkw/00biz-goodwill-qzkw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill stores are thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is good news for the nonprofit organization that oversees Goodwill, the world’s largest thrift store chain. But it also signals that Americans in an uncertain economy are trying to stretch their dollars as far as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization, Goodwill Industries, said it surpassed $7 billion in revenue — a record — from its 3,400 stores in 2025, up roughly 7 percent from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are pretty steady in almost any economic situation,” Steven C. Preston, Goodwill’s chief executive, said in an interview. “But when things are tight, we’re probably more likely to get that foot traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the consumer economy, holiday spending remained strong last year, and consumers are still spending on discretionary goods, even if they have to defer the costs through “buy now, pay later” plans. But a cocktail of inflation, slowing job growth and lofty bills for groceries and rent has left American households looking to eke out as much as they can with every purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a cold January day, David Collon, 48, went to a Goodwill store in northern Manhattan looking for sweatpants and sweaters. “They have a good selection, and I’m looking for a very good price at this time,” said Mr. Collon, who works as a groundskeeper. “It’s hard times. This brings down the pain of spending for clothes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill shops present a sensory overload of inventory. Shoppers go for the low prices, but also the treasure hunt of rifling through aisles of shirts and dresses for hidden gems. At the outlets that sell items lumped together in bins, some customers wait for hours for goods to be refreshed to maximize their hauls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill’s secondhand peers have also seen a boost. Savers Value Village, which operates more than 300 stores mostly in the United States and Canada, said net sales grew nearly 16 percent in its most recent quarter. The online consignment shop ThredUp said its revenue rose 34 percent last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrift stores are some of the only places that can offer $5 T-shirts and $15 jeans, and are shielded from tariff-related price increases because they don’t import goods manufactured abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Secondhand stores are benefiting from many of the same forces we’re seeing across the broader economy,” said Michelle Meyer, chief economist of the Mastercard Economics Institute. “Consumers are becoming far more value‑conscious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill is a nonprofit business that relies on donations and its retail stores to fund its programs, which include career skills training, education and community programs for those in need. It also offers services for formerly incarcerated people to re-enter the work force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill collects about six billion pounds of goods per year and tries to keep as many items in circulation as possible. Items that are not sold in stores go to outlets, where they are heavily discounted and sold in bulk by the pound, or they go through partner resellers. Some products may end up in overseas markets or recycling facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives are trying out partnerships with retailers to prompt more donations. Last year, Goodwill began a pilot project with Amazon, hosting return kiosks inside its stores so that customers can combine their drop-off errands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the slowing economy, shifting consumer trends are boosting Goodwill’s sales. Much of the growth is coming from Generation Z and millennials who see secondhand clothes not only as cheaper but also as more sustainable and fashionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill’s annual sales are up nearly 50 percent from 2019, in part because of young shoppers like Steph Tauszik, 20, a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, who was shopping for a winter coat at a Goodwill store. “It’s cheaper, and it’s good for the planet in terms of not over consuming,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s an entire shift in mind-set,” said David Eagles, Goodwill’s chief operating officer. “It’s sustainable, it’s personal, it’s local.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, young consumers are sharing their thrift hauls on TikTok and YouTube, showing off the clothes they often find from online resellers like the RealReal, Depop and Poshmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill, for its part, is also pushing an online auction site, which also had its biggest year ever, though it represents only a small portion of total sales. That platform sources goods exclusively from local Goodwill shops, with the proceeds of each sale going back to the affiliates that listed the item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management sees the secondhand surge as an opportunity for expansion. That means more places for Goodwill to both gather goods and sell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, Goodwill expects to add between 50 and 100 new stores across North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hopeful we will accelerate growth,” Mr. Eagles said, adding that 2026 “will probably be our biggest year yet — that’s our goal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26biz-gold-prices1-kgvw/26biz-gold-prices1-kgvw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of gold reached a record high on Monday, surging above $5,000 an ounce, as investors sought a safe haven amid heightened geopolitical tensions and rising global risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot gold prices jumped as high as $5,102 an ounce, after climbing 8 percent last week. Other precious metals were also rising. The price of silver topped $100 an ounce on Monday and hit $109.83, a record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock markets were up slightly at the start of trading on Monday ahead of a stream of company financial results expected this week, and ahead of a meeting of the Federal Reserve, which is expected to keep interest rates steady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are seeking shelter from global uncertainty, including strains between the United States and the European Union over President Trump’s determination to take over Greenland, leading to fears of a renewed trade war. Tensions in Ukraine, Venezuela and the Middle East continue to simmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say gold is now on track for its best year since 1979, when prices soared during a period of runaway inflation, a weakening dollar and instability in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is comfort in holding an asset perceived as secure in a world where the global order may be shifting,” Chris Weston, the head of research at Pepperstone, a financial services company, wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect of another U.S. government shutdown has amplified Wall Street’s anxiety. Several key Democrats in Congress said they would withhold their support from a bipartisan spending bill after federal agents fatally shot a Minneapolis resident on Saturday. The standoff over the bill, which includes funding for the Department of Homeland Security, raises the likelihood of the shutdown at the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold prices began climbing in early 2024, when the precious metal broke out of a narrow trading range and surged past $2,350 an ounce by spring. At first, the move reflected concerns about persistent inflation and growing global tensions, but it soon took on broader meaning as investors grew broadly uneasy about the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rally progressed in 2025. Central banks continued to add to their reserves, while more investors started to view gold as protection against political and financial blows. Those concerns intensified in October, when gold prices sharply jumped toward $4,000 an ounce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices have continued to climb since then. Gold has benefited, in part, because other assets investors usually turn to for stability are looking less dependable. The U.S. dollar has weakened as the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. The turmoil abroad has weighed on other major currencies such as the yen and the euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising debt and deficits have also cast doubts about U.S. creditworthiness, making Treasuries a less dependable safe haven.&lt;/p&gt;

Nobody Seems to Care.</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/business/media/brooklyn-beckham-victoria-feud-ai-videos-dancing.html</link><description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/multimedia/00Beckham-AI-jqml/00Beckham-AI-jqml-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn Beckham left a few things out when he publicly cut ties with his famous family this week, but it took the internet just a few hours to concoct fake evidence to fill in the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eldest son of David Beckham, a former British soccer star, and Victoria Beckham, a fashion designer and former Spice Girl, blasted his parents in a series of Instagram Stories on Monday night. A key accusation: that the power duo had repeatedly tried to sabotage Brooklyn’s relationship with his wife, Nicola Peltz, the daughter of the billionaire investor Nelson Peltz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media users were enthralled by the drama, an age-old response to the spectacle of public discord in the ranks of the rich and beautiful. This time, though, the audience didn’t wait for verified evidence to be released or leaked. Instead, people took control of the narrative by using artificial intelligence to imagine what might have happened behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn claimed, for example, that his mother “danced very inappropriately” with him at his wedding in 2022 — a situation that has not been publicly corroborated by authentic footage from the event. Into the void came a slew of realistic A.I. clips purporting to show Victoria shimmying, leaping, flailing, gyrating and recreating movie scenes from “Saturday Night Fever” and “Pulp Fiction” at the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The A.I. videos and images offered an entertaining and plausible — though phony — glimpse into the Beckhams’ personal lives. Many people, their curiosity sated, did not seem to care that the content was fake. Users left comments sprinkled with laughing emojis, like “they keep getting better and better” and “the first acceptable use of A.I. I’ve ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beckhams did not respond to requests for comment. Brooklyn and Nicola admired people’s creativity, according to a person close to the couple, who was speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the situation. But the couple felt that A.I. renderings could not capture the reality of how poorly they say they were treated by Brooklyn’s family, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are people who are hungry for a particular kind of content, and if you can create that content for them, they will eat it up,” said Kristian J. Hammond, a computer science professor and A.I. expert at Northwestern University. “Here’s a moment where, if you want to believe it, you will, and those are the moments where we have to resist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With A.I. becoming increasingly accessible, famous people are irresistible — and easy — targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, a celebrity gets the digital treatment without his or her consent. Social media users are turning to tools with names like Nano Banana Pro to generate convincing selfies with Hollywood stars (think Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet on the “Titanic” set, or at a party with three recent “Spider-Man” actors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting content is not always harmless. Such technology has also been used to undress famous people or to place them in sexual situations. After the conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated, A.I.-generated musical tributes from artists with avowedly different political views — among them Adele, Eminem and Lady Gaga — surfaced on YouTube, according to the Poynter Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To many people who have been breathlessly following the Beckham feud, it is clear that the A.I. images of the family are not real (though social media users have filled comment sections with surprise at how convincing the content seems). The internet has devoured the posts, with some racking up hundreds of thousands of views. In the absence of actual footage, the A.I. renderings of Victoria and Brooklyn could become the default images of the dance, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Scottish digital artist known professionally as Hey Reilly used a mix of A.I. programs and Photoshop to create a series of Beckham images that has been liked more than 1.5 million times on Instagram. He wrote in an email that visualizing the wedding was “just a fundamentally funny idea” and noted that much of his work is “very obviously ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If someone thinks the aim is to fool people, they’re missing the point entirely,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Beckhams’ case, A.I. can produce whatever juicy details the public demands, even if they are inaccurate. The synthetic versions of Victoria and Nicola, many of them clad in the actual dresses they wore to the nuptials, scratch the internet’s itch for answers, and allow people to move on to their next fixation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casey Fiesler, an associate professor of information science at the University of Colorado Boulder, described the A.I. dance posts as a sort of visual fan fiction, similar to the content that is created to bridge missing scenes in books and films, to illustrate courtroom sessions or even to depict historical events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Fiesler said she was concerned about people who did not care at all whether the content was real. Disinformation researchers and fact checkers have raised alarm in recent years over a growing state of disinterest in facts, especially in a world where the White House posts manipulated images of real people, and politicians declare that the emotional impact of images is more important than their authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I worry that we can get to a kind of learned helplessness in this information ecosystem where it’s like, ‘I’m never going to be able to know whether anything’s real anymore, so why bother?’” Dr. Fiesler said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If that’s the case,” she added, “then there’s an argument that even small things or things that seem frivolous are just, over time, wearing us down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/STATIONS-1-01-fzkm/STATIONS-1-01-fzkm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things looked bleak last summer for KCAW, a tiny public radio station serving the remote community of Sitka, Alaska (population 8,393).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress had just slashed $500 million in funding for public media, blowing a $187,500 hole in the station’s budget. Mariana Robertson, the station’s general manager, said she had faced a potential “doomsday” situation that included cutting staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the donations poured in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Ms. Robertson is one of many station directors across America who find themselves in unexpected territory: first, expecting the worst, but then buoyed by a flood of emergency funding that has kept their stations stable and surviving. For now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a huge success story, and we’re so grateful and thrilled,” Ms. Robertson said. “But the future is unclear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When government funding disappeared from public media last year, experts predicted dire consequences for scores of stations. According to one estimate, 78 public radio stations and 37 TV stations were at risk of going dark as a result of the cuts. President Trump recently said NPR and PBS had “closed up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But six months after the funding cuts, few public TV or radio stations have closed their doors. Many have scraped together a patchwork of funding from concerned donors, philanthropies or government grants. Others, facing insurmountable budget issues, have resorted to mergers with bigger stations to stay online. NPR and PBS have not gone anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the country’s public media system — more than 1,000 radio and TV stations, serving millions of people — remains largely intact, despite the disappearance of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is not a lot of celebrating among public media executives and supporters. Much of the angst about the long-term future remains. They point out that much of the money making up for the loss in federal funding has come from one-off donations and grants — short-term fixes — that may have managed only to defer the true financial pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not out of the woods at all,” said Tim Isgitt, chief executive of Public Media Company, a nonprofit that has stepped in to provide $30 million in emergency funding to rescue public TV and radio stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several stations teetered on the edge of insolvency when they applied for and received funding through the Public Media Bridge Fund, the program administered by Mr. Isgitt’s company. But the fund is not designed to be a long-term solution. Mr. Isgitt said it was designed to give jeopardized stations time to transition to a more sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those recipients is KWMR, a public radio station based in the coastal hamlet of Point Reyes Station, Calif. Amanda Eichstaedt, the station’s manager and executive director, scrambled to adjust for a 26 percent budget cut this summer, which she feared would result in a staff reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But listeners “really stepped up,” Ms. Eichstaedt said. They started a “25 to stay alive” campaign that aimed to patch together the quarter of the budget that had been snatched by Congress. Ultimately, they pitched in roughly $150,000, making up for the lost government money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tsunami of donations to public media stations last year resulted in an increase of roughly $300 million from the year before, with new donors growing by about 84 percent, said Michal Heiplik, president and chief executive of the Contributor Development Partnership, a firm that analyzes public media fund-raising data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other changes also helped stabilize stations: NPR and PBS reduced fees for members, some stations tapped cash reserves and others laid off employees to avoid going out of business, Mr. Heiplik said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not ready to declare a win, but the increase in community support is very encouraging,” Mr. Heiplik said. “There needs to be a lot more that is done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of Native American tribal stations, considered by many to be among the most vulnerable, received funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. But that funding is projected to last only through the end of this year, said Loris Taylor, the president and chief executive of Native Public Media. After that, 36 of the stations in Ms. Taylor’s network will have to fill an $11 million gap with a mix of fund-raising, emergency grants and other revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So far, none of the stations are closing their doors,” Ms. Taylor said. “They are continuing to provide service to their communities, but it’s not because the system is suddenly stable. It’s because our stations are drawing on short-term stopgaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option for struggling stations is combining with a more well-funded organization. That was the plan announced late last year at WPSU, a PBS and NPR station based at Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university initially said the station would shut down because of financial challenges exacerbated by government defunding. Ultimately, the university’s board of trustees approved a plan to transfer WPSU’s assets to WHYY, the public media powerhouse in the Philadelphia area behind shows such as “Fresh Air.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Marrazzo, the chief executive of WHYY, said Congress’s decision to claw back funding was forcing public media leaders to grapple with business model challenges they would have had to reckon with eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rescission certainly accelerated the point where that kind of thinking needs to occur,” Mr. Marrazzo said. “But in my mind, as a business matter, it’s inevitable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As wintry conditions and frigid temperatures gripped much of the United States this weekend, the nation’s power system has avoided buckling like it has in past years. But the system continued to face severe strain early Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of residents and businesses largely in the southern parts of the country had no electricity. Most of those outages resulted from the typical challenges that accompany winter storms: snow piling up on electrical equipment and ice dangling from branches and power lines, causing them to snap. And with temperatures below freezing and demand for electricity expected to stay high, outages could very likely expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm this weekend blanketed wide parts of the nation under more than a foot of snow in some places and sheets of ice in others. Some weather models are predicting another storm, but meteorologists have cautioned that the forecast was hypothetical and should not be treated as a certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This next wave of ice that may be coming in is going to test the system even further,” said Calvin Butler, the chief executive of Exelon, which owns regulated utilities in New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Illinois. “All that ice, they’re just not used to it,” he said, referring to the Southeast. “We’re more used to hurricanes in the Southeast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive winter storm that moved from the Southwest to the Northeast comes as electric grids struggle to manage a staggering rise in electricity demand from data centers, some of which support the development of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first major test of the power system’s resilience during a potent winter storm in the era of huge data center expansion. In an unusual move, the Department of Energy late Sunday ordered the manager of Texas’ main electric grid, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, to direct data centers and other facilities that consume a lot of energy to begin using backup generators in an effort to prevent blackouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other grid operators, ERCOT issued weather alerts ahead of the storm but expected conditions on the system to remain normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas experienced a widespread electric grid failure during a severe winter storm in February 2021 that killed more than 200 people. Energy companies in the state have since added more batteries, power plants and other resources, but industry experts said the state still had work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the fourth once-in-a-hundred-year winter storm in ERCOT in 25 years,” said Robert McCullough, of McCullough Research, a consulting firm in Portland, Ore. “We are forecasting poorly and preparing even worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Edison Electric Institute, a utility industry organization, is coordinating responses to the winter storm with executives of power companies across the country. That has helped utilities deploy 65,000 lineman and other workers to respond to power outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People and trucks are rolling across the country, even throughout this weather to help people,” Mr. Butler of Exelon said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post is reversing course on its Winter Olympics plans — again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper originally intended to send more than a dozen journalists to cover the event, which has long been a major priority for The Post. Those employees were notified in a terse email on Friday, less than three weeks before the Olympics begin, that The Post would not send any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, The Post expects to send four journalists, according to three people with knowledge of the decision. A spokeswoman for The Post confirmed the paper would be sending a small contingent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After The Post’s change of plans became public last week, admirers of the newspaper’s sports section raised objections on social media, noting the awkward timing of the decision and the effect it could have on coverage. Christine Brennan, a columnist for USA Today who was The Post’s Olympics beat writer from 1988 to 1996, wrote on X that it was a “stunning and awful development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees at The Post were taken by surprise, in part because the company had already made significant investments to cover the Winter Games. Flights had already been booked for the journalists’ travel to Italy, where the event is being held, and The Post had already spent roughly $80,000 for lodging.&lt;/p&gt;

President Trump on Monday said he would raise tariffs on South Korea.
