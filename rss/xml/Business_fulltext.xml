&lt;p&gt;Airlines and airports on Friday were preparing for widespread disruptions this weekend as a powerful storm threatened to blanket large parts of the country in ice and snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm was expected to hit much of the Southern United States on Friday, prompting some targeted flight cancellations. Delta Air Lines had proactively canceled some Friday flights in northern Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee, but most cancellations were on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Friday afternoon, American Airlines, which is based in Fort Worth, had canceled 19 percent of flights planned for Saturday, while Southwest Airlines, based in Dallas, had canceled 17 percent, according to FlightAware. At Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, about two in three flights scheduled for Saturday were already canceled, according to Cirium, an aviation data firm. Delta also warned of cancellations Saturday in the Midwest and South.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airlines have an easier time managing around bad weather at a single airport, but this storm is much more dangerous because of its breadth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have a storm that’s going to progress from the center of the country all the way to the East Coast and a very wide swath north to south,” said Bob Mann, an industry consultant and a former airline executive. “The area of impact and the duration of the impact is far longer than the standard weather event.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week and next are typically among the slowest of the year, according to Transportation Security Administration airport screening data. As a result, carriers may have more flexibility and resources to respond to disruptions over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Friday, many airlines had waived fees to change weekend travel, allowing customers to postpone travel from or through many major airports in the eastern half of the United States. Carriers encouraged travelers to confirm their flight status before leaving for the airport, and several airlines said they were shoring up resources to better handle the chaos expected in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta said it expected the storm to affect about 80 cities it flies to. The airline also said it was sending experts from its hubs in colder climates to help with de-icing and baggage support in Southern airports, including those in Atlanta; Birmingham, Ala.; and Nashville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparing to bounce back after a disruption is often as important as managing the disruption in the first place. American said in a statement that it was moving personnel and planes around to be prepared in the storm’s aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re repositioning aircraft, aligning crew resources and reinforcing staffing at key airports while coordinating with our partners to help minimize disruption and set the stage for a fast, safe recovery,” the airline said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most ominous weather forecasts called for ice and a foot or more of snow in some places. In such conditions, airport runways and taxiways have to be plowed for planes to safely move about, and jets often line up to be doused in de-icing fluid to remove and prevent ice accumulation, slowing operations even at airports that are used to such conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That de-icing process is complex and expensive, especially at airports not used to severe winter conditions. But it is essential to flight safety. Even small amounts of ice can affect a jet’s aerodynamics, hindering pilots’ ability to operate various functions. For American, Chicago O’Hare International Airport is home to the airline’s biggest de-icing operation, treating planes 6,000 to 10,000 times every winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While airports in the South may not be as familiar with icy conditions, many do deal with them from time to time. Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, a hub in American’s network, said it had a fleet of 40 snow-removal, de-icing and maintenance vehicles at the ready. In 2022, Memphis International Airport debuted a de-icing facility that cost more than $300 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At airline command centers, teams of experts work around the clock to monitor flights and help manage and resolve problems as they arise. But such work can be especially complicated because displaced planes, crews, flights or customers can have cascading effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As flights are delayed, pilots and flight attendants sometimes reach legal work limits, forcing airlines to cancel more flights or call in replacement crews. A flight attendant stranded in, say, Nashville can’t work a flight in Chicago the next day as planned. Poor conditions can also force planes to be diverted and not be available for a future flight they were scheduled for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/multimedia/25biz-minnesota-ceos-target-fgbv/25biz-minnesota-ceos-target-fgbv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executives of Target, Best Buy, General Mills and Cargill were among more than 60 large Minnesota companies to issue a public letter on Sunday calling for an “immediate de-escalation of tensions” in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter marks the first time the most recognizable businesses in Minnesota have weighed in on the turmoil in Minneapolis amid the aggressive crackdown by federal immigration agents, which have sparked widespread protests throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes one day after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti, a nurse at the city’s Veterans Affairs hospital, while he was being restrained on a Minneapolis sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With yesterday’s tragic news, we are calling for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions,” the letter states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter was signed by top executives of Minnesota’s largest companies and large hospital systems, including Land O’ Lakes, Hormel, U.S. Bancorp, Mayo Clinic and 3M. It also was signed by local sports teams: the Minnesota Vikings, Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Minnesota Wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter is notable because many chief executives have sought to avoid weighing in on any politically charged issues during the second Trump administration. On Friday, hundreds of smaller businesses in the Minneapolis area shut their doors as they backed protests against the actions from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter was shared by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than 6,000 businesses across the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours later, Josh Bolten, the chief executive of the Business Roundtable, an association of more than 200 chief executives of America’s leading companies, said in an emailed statement that he supported the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce’s letter. Beth Ford, the chief executive of Land O’ Lakes, sits on the Business Roundtable’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Sunday, the largest companies in Minnesota had not addressed the issue, but in the Chamber of Commerce letter they said they had been in contact with federal, state and local officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The silence by big companies had been a marked contrast from their responses to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020. That murder helped set off a broader corporate movement to fight racism, with executives making public pledges to support diversity initiatives, donate to social justice causes and express solidarity with demonstrators at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the years since, companies have sought to avoid being caught in any political cross hairs, as the country has become more polarized. Many have said they will be more selective about the issues they tackle, sticking only to those that directly affect their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the World Economic Forum last week, once a hotbed for such social issues, there was hardly any public mention by executives of the unrest in Minnesota. The focus was instead on artificial intelligence, deal making and the reshaping of global alliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for some companies, the violence in Minnesota has hit particularly close to home. After immigration agents detained two employees at the Target store in Richfield, Minn., this month, clergy members gathered at the retailer’s headquarters, asking the company to keep immigration agents off its properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every C.E.O. — and I know all these C.E.O.s — they want to have a peaceful environment for their employees,” said Bill George, the former chief executive of Medtronic, whose current chief signed the letter. Mr. George is also a former board member at Target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The larger issue for C.E.O.s,” he added, is that the unrest in Minneapolis “is going to have a very negative effect on their growth, on their innovation and particularly their ability to recruit people from around the country and around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking as a group, as Minnesota executives did Sunday, could help insulate companies from individual attacks from Mr. Trump, said Jeff Sonnenfeld, a professor of leadership studies at the Yale School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can take down companies individually, but when they work collectively, they have immunity,” Mr. Sonnenfeld said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives similarly relied on the law of numbers in expressing concerns about tariffs, which organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce came out in opposition to last spring. Many companies ultimately struck their own deals with the administration over tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday’s letter stopped short of calling for specific action nor did the corporations condemn the shooting of Mr. Pretti by the federal agents or call for immigration authorities to rein in their aggressive enforcement. The statement also did not call on protesters to change their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With polls showing voters split along party lines on whether they support President Trump’s immigration crackdown, corporations have been careful not to alienate large numbers of their customers by taking a side. They also risk angering Mr. Trump, who has publicly rebuked companies and executives he believes have crossed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter from the Minnesota companies on Sunday struck a neutral tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused cooperation among local, state and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution that enables families, businesses, our employees, and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future,” the executives wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor of business and society at the N.Y.U. Stern business school, said she thought the companies had no choice but to say something. “They have been backed into a corner, because obviously the situation going on is starting to have commercial consequences,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Taylor added: “Is it better than doing nothing? Probably. Is it sufficient? I don’t think anyone’s going to think this is sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26Biz-Europe-LNG-01-phlv/26Biz-Europe-LNG-01-phlv-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, it also tried to squeeze Europe by crimping natural gas flows. But increased shipments of liquid natural gas, much of it from the United States, helped ease the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, smoldering tensions between leaders in Washington and Brussels could turn Europe’s reliance on American natural gas into a similar political pressure point, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve replaced one massive dependency with another one,” said Henning Gloystein, a managing director for energy at Eurasia Group, a political risk research firm. “That looked fine three years ago, but now it doesn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to import large amounts of energy is one of Europe’s strategic weaknesses. Natural gas from Russia was a mainstay for the continent before the invasion of Ukraine. In 2019, for instance, Russian gas accounted for more than half of the European Union’s gas imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The huge volumes of Russian gas that flowed through pipelines across Ukraine and Poland and under the Baltic Sea plummeted in the wake of the assault. Prices soared, putting pressure on consumers, industries and governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States came to the rescue. Tankers loaded at U.S. terminals shipped large volumes of liquefied natural gas to European ports in the Netherlands, France and Belgium, among other destinations, helping to replace the Russian fuel and calming markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the United States had been a modest supplier of natural gas to Europe, with about 5 percent of imports in late 2019, but it has since grown, providing more than a quarter of the European Union’s gas imports in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: Bruegel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By The New York Times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, those gas flows looked heroic. Now, they are raising eyebrows. Since beginning his second term, President Trump has sought to use trade as leverage in disputes with other countries, including his recent push to take over Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing concern in Europe is that Mr. Trump could turn the strong position that the United States has gained in the oil and gas industry into a weapon to try to coerce other countries. “Recently, people have started to realize we are probably a little bit too dependent on U.S. L.N.G.,” said Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a global research scholar in Paris for the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has encouraged this reliance, pushing Europe to increase U.S. imports as part of the trade deal struck with the European Union last year. In 2025, L.N.G. flows from the United States to European Union countries jumped about 60 percent from the previous year, according to Bruegel, a research organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say these volumes are likely to increase. Although Europe invests in renewable energy like wind and solar power, it still requires natural gas for heating homes and manufacturing goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe is also producing less of its own fuel because its existing oil and gas fields are winding down, and countries like Britain, whose petroleum production has fallen sharply, discourage new drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Europe is without much alternative,” said Christoph Halser, a senior analyst at Rystad Energy, a consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly in response to American complaints, Europe is also in the process of phasing out its purchases of Russian gas, which fell to around 12 percent of imports in 2025. Norway, which is not a European Union member, is the bloc’s largest gas supplier, accounting for around 30 percent of imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States is already the world leader in L.N.G. exports, and developers are spending heavily to build facilities for chilling gas to liquid form and then shipping it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe, which is a relatively short sail from terminals on the Gulf Coast, is a logical destination for these cargoes. China, the world’s largest importer of liquefied natural gas, has largely stopped buying American fuel because of U.S. tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, a bright spot for Europe may be that a supply boom is expected in the coming years, which could bring down what have been relatively high prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the event of increased political tensions with Europe, some analysts are skeptical that the Trump administration would take steps like reducing shipments that would be contrary to the interests of the U.S. oil and gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That “would be a very negative market signal, and also significantly impair the competitiveness of the industry, which the administration is committed to supporting,” said David L. Goldwyn, a former U.S. energy special envoy and now president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, a consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry in the United States also differs markedly from Russia’s. There, the Kremlin was able to use Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly, “to weaponize gas flows in 2022,” Jack Reid, a graduate economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a recent study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States, he added, is more likely to “redirect flows than bring them to a halt.” Other analysts speculate that Washington might take measures like putting an export tax on gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, though, meddling with gas flows is likely to lead to higher costs and prices, analysts say, which would be bad news for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Import concentration” matters, said Ugne Keliauskaite, a research analyst at Bruegel. “Now Europe is more exposed to U.S.-centered disruptions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/00biz-goodwill-qzkw/00biz-goodwill-qzkw-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill stores are thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is good news for the nonprofit organization that oversees Goodwill, the world’s largest thrift store chain. But it also signals that Americans in an uncertain economy are trying to stretch their dollars as far as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization, Goodwill Industries, said it surpassed $7 billion in revenue — a record — from its 3,400 stores in 2025, up roughly 7 percent from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are pretty steady in almost any economic situation,” Steven C. Preston, Goodwill’s chief executive, said in an interview. “But when things are tight, we’re probably more likely to get that foot traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the consumer economy, holiday spending remained strong last year, and consumers are still spending on discretionary goods, even if they have to defer the costs through “buy now, pay later” plans. But a cocktail of inflation, slowing job growth and lofty bills for groceries and rent has left American households looking to eke out as much as they can with every purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a cold January day, David Collon, 48, went to a Goodwill store in northern Manhattan looking for sweatpants and sweaters. “They have a good selection, and I’m looking for a very good price at this time,” said Mr. Collon, who works as a groundskeeper. “It’s hard times. This brings down the pain of spending for clothes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill shops present a sensory overload of inventory. Shoppers go for the low prices, but also the treasure hunt of rifling through aisles of shirts and dresses for hidden gems. At the outlets that sell items lumped together in bins, some customers wait for hours for goods to be refreshed to maximize their hauls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill’s secondhand peers have also seen a boost. Savers Value Village, which operates more than 300 stores mostly in the United States and Canada, said net sales grew nearly 16 percent in its most recent quarter. The online consignment shop ThredUp said its revenue rose 34 percent last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrift stores are some of the only places that can offer $5 T-shirts and $15 jeans, and are shielded from tariff-related price increases because they don’t import goods manufactured abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Secondhand stores are benefiting from many of the same forces we’re seeing across the broader economy,” said Michelle Meyer, chief economist of the Mastercard Economics Institute. “Consumers are becoming far more value‑conscious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill is a nonprofit business that relies on donations and its retail stores to fund its programs, which include career skills training, education and community programs for those in need. It also offers services for formerly incarcerated people to re-enter the work force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill collects about six billion pounds of goods per year and tries to keep as many items in circulation as possible. Items that are not sold in stores go to outlets, where they are heavily discounted and sold in bulk by the pound, or they go through partner resellers. Some products may end up in overseas markets or recycling facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives are trying out partnerships with retailers to prompt more donations. Last year, Goodwill began a pilot project with Amazon, hosting return kiosks inside its stores so that customers can combine their drop-off errands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the slowing economy, shifting consumer trends are boosting Goodwill’s sales. Much of the growth is coming from Generation Z and millennials who see secondhand clothes not only as cheaper but also as more sustainable and fashionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill’s annual sales are up nearly 50 percent from 2019, in part because of young shoppers like Steph Tauszik, 20, a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, who was shopping for a winter coat at a Goodwill store. “It’s cheaper, and it’s good for the planet in terms of not over consuming,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s an entire shift in mind-set,” said David Eagles, Goodwill’s chief operating officer. “It’s sustainable, it’s personal, it’s local.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, young consumers are sharing their thrift hauls on TikTok and YouTube, showing off the clothes they often find from online resellers like the RealReal, Depop and Poshmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwill, for its part, is also pushing an online auction site, which also had its biggest year ever, though it represents only a small portion of total sales. That platform sources goods exclusively from local Goodwill shops, with the proceeds of each sale going back to the affiliates that listed the item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management sees the secondhand surge as an opportunity for expansion. That means more places for Goodwill to both gather goods and sell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, Goodwill expects to add between 50 and 100 new stores across North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hopeful we will accelerate growth,” Mr. Eagles said, adding that 2026 “will probably be our biggest year yet — that’s our goal.”&lt;/p&gt;
