&lt;p&gt;College can help open your mind or close it. College can push you toward a spirit of curiosity, or it can reaffirm your pre-existing convictions and confirm your blinkered worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to overstate what a college can do. It’s not as if college students are mere lumps of moral and intellectual clay that can be shaped and formed at will by professors and administrators, or by one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask a professor, and he or she is likely to tell you that students usually arrive on campus with strong pre-existing ideologies and theologies. Students interested in politics, in particular, often come to campus as committed activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professors, however, still have influence, I know that I arrived on my college and law school campuses with a host of fierce convictions. My best professors urged me to question my assumptions, to test them against the new facts I was learning and to ask whether new information (and better reasoning) might change my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the only kind of college experience. Many students walk into college echo chambers, and very little about their education causes them to question their beliefs, much less change their minds. Instead of gaining humility, they increase their pride. And this arrogance and sense of certainty have contributed immeasurably to our national enmity and polarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of the University of Austin gives us a glimpse of both the problem and the solution. New institutions can be an answer to the failures of the old, but they’re still subject to the same temptations and can easily slide into the same mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Austin, or UATX, was launched with much fanfare in 2021. The goal was to create a new highly selective university that would be free of the maladies and pathologies that plagued so many legacy universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders of the new university included Niall Ferguson, a leading historian; Bari Weiss, formerly of The Times, the founder of The Free Press, and the current head of CBS News; and Joe Lonsdale, a billionaire co-founder of Palantir Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be a mistake to describe the new university as merely a right-wing institution. Among its early advisers were Nadine Strossen, a former president of the American Civil Liberties Union, and famous centrist academics such as Steven Pinker and Jonathan Haidt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if you peruse the entire list of early founders and advisers, the word you’d use to describe the vast majority of them isn’t necessarily “right-wing” or “left-wing” but rather “liberal,” in the classical definition of the term — committed to free expression, the rule of law and open inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their very presence on the list of UATX’s early founders and advisers was an indictment of elite legacy institutions, all too many of which had become deeply illiberal as a matter of policy and of culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much has happened over the past year that it’s easy to forget the persistent problems of the American academy. For example, a majority of students in a national survey reported feeling intimidated about voicing their true opinions on hot-button political topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can understand why. I teach at a college. I speak at many colleges across the country. And when I ask students why they don’t speak up more, or why they don’t debate their peers in class, I hear the same reason again and again: They don’t want to lose friends. They don’t want to risk their grades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these aren’t the fears of closet Klansmen but rather of people who hold thoughtful, mainstream positions that differ from the progressive orthodoxy on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ideological orthodoxy were enforced only through peer pressure, that would be troublesome enough. But campus illiberalism had long ago moved far beyond social pressure and into the realm of university policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speech codes and bias response teams have chilled speech on many campuses. Some universities have required job applicants to articulate their views on diversity, equity and inclusion — in effect creating formal ideological litmus tests for hiring and promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did so many classical liberals from the right and left join UATX? Because campus illiberalism requires a response, and one of the best and most productive forms of response is to build new and better institutions, to offer students a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know someone who would want to read this? Share the column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Steven Pinker is no longer affiliated with UATX. Neither, reportedly, is Jonathan Haidt or Nadine Strossen. Nor are many others among the leading liberal writers and thinkers from the left or right. By the end of last summer, close to half the original cohort of prominent supporters had parted ways with the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Politico Magazine published a long and fascinating account of the divisions at UATX, by Evan Mandery, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mandery writes, a key moment occurred on April 2, 2025, when professors and staff gathered to hear from Lonsdale, a member of the board. According to the writer and academic Michael Lind, who was a visiting professor at the time, Lonsdale told the gathering that every member of the faculty and staff had to subscribe to four principles — anticommunism, antisocialism, opposition to identity politics and anti-Islamism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defenders of the university labeled Mandery’s article a “hit piece”; Lonsdale himself doubled down. “If you’re on a university board and are not attacked for purging commies,” he posted on X, “or making sure commie-adjacent bureaucrats don’t screw up your institution, then you’re not doing your job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, in right-wing America, the word “commie” does not refer exclusively to actual communists (of whom there are very few in the American academy) but often to the whole kaleidoscope of American progressivism. Ideas or people whom populists don’t like constantly find themselves labeled socialist, communist or Marxist — at least when the term “woke” is deemed insufficiently derisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, according to Mandery’s account, UATX wasn’t creating a true alternative to legacy elite institutions but rather their mirror image — a place that imposes its own ideological boundaries and that is proving inhospitable to dissenting voices. Rather than answering illiberalism with liberalism, it was threatening to respond in kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of UATX isn’t yet written. The college is new, and there are still a number of outstanding individuals on the faculty and in leadership, but the red flags are flying. The school may already be at a crossroads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer our nation slogs through this terrible political moment, the more I’m convinced that the real national conflict isn’t between left and right — it’s between liberal and illiberal, decent and indecent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that brings us back to the clash between curiosity and conviction. I like to tell people that in the course of my education I attended two religious institutions — Lipscomb University, a Christian college in Nashville (where I teach classes today), and Harvard Law School, an ostensibly secular and diverse professional school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I was at Harvard in the early 1990s, it felt more like an ideological boot camp than Lipscomb had. The vast majority of my professors were of one mind. So were the vast majority of my peers. Although there were certainly liberal-minded students and professors, much of my education felt like training for activism more than inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spirit of activism wasn’t new. It had developed steadily after the tumult of the 1960s, and by the 1980s it was bearing bitter fruit in the form of the university speech code. After all, what value is free speech if you’ve figured out the most important answers to the most important questions in life? How can we implement our vision of social justice if we’re divided by dissent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, this mind-set results in a startling ideological monoculture, in which almost everyone around you is broadly in your ideological camp. When almost every smart person you know agrees with you to some important degree, then it’s very easy to slide to the conclusion that your opponents aren’t just wrong but potentially even stupid or evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who wants stupid or evil people on campus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best colleges, by contrast, take the opposite approach. They don’t teach you to double down on your convictions but rather to approach the world with a spirit of curiosity. It’s not that curious people shouldn’t have convictions; but their convictions should be tempered by humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m an imperfect person. I don’t know everything. I will never know everything. Therefore, I should approach the world with an open heart and an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an institution committed cultivating curiosity, speech codes are anathema. The last thing it wants to do is to stifle discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of institution isn’t trying to train and mobilize young ideological shock troops, cannon fodder in the culture wars. Instead, it uses its influence to cultivate people who will remain curious their entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preservation of our Republic requires us to be double-minded. We have to respond to the emergency of the moment — whether we’re facing threats against a NATO ally or systematic constitutional violations in the streets of Minneapolis — and, at the same time, rethink and rebuild the institutions that put us in this terrible place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that means using whatever influence that colleges do have to introduce a single important thought into even the most ideologically and religiously committed young minds: What if I’m wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is that recognition that can change a life. It is that recognition that can open a heart. And it’s that recognition that allows us to turn to a friend, a neighbor and even an ideological opponent and sincerely ask one of the most important questions you can ask — what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26winter-storm-nyc-schools-kczb/26winter-storm-nyc-schools-kczb-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 350,000 public school students in New York City participated in remote learning on Monday after the city was pummeled by a winter storm that dropped nearly a foot of snow in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Zohran Mamdani decided to hold classes online instead of canceling them, disappointing some children who hoped to spend the day outdoors. City officials said that the move to remote classes had gone smoothly and they had resolved some technical issues with the Google Classroom website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Mamdani said at a news conference on Monday morning that he expected school to reopen on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I did visit a classroom this morning remotely alongside the chancellor and reiterated my offer to students that they could pelt me in the face with a snowball,” Mr. Mamdani said. “They were very excited about that and asked for a time and place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 500,000 students were expected to participate in remote learning, and about 70 percent had logged in by 10:30 a.m., city officials said. Some families had technical issues or decided not to join. About 125,000 school staffers logged on to online classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school students and some middle school students had the day off as part of a previously scheduled “professional development day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some families had trouble logging in through Google Classroom and received an error message. Some were able to refresh and join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last remote learning day in 2024, there were widespread technical problems. Parents called it a “total disaster.” The mayor at the time, Eric Adams, called it a “teaching moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote learning became common during the coronavirus pandemic. But it presents challenges for parents who must juggle their own work with logging into online classrooms and for parents who must work in person.&lt;/p&gt;

Children and families went sledding in Prospect Park in Brooklyn on Monday.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26met-columbia-presidentHFO-cqjb/26met-columbia-presidentHFO-cqjb-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="Article image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbia University has chosen Jennifer Mnookin, the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, as its next president, hoping to usher in a period of growth and stability after a tumultuous two years on its campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mnookin, 58, is a legal scholar who served as the dean of the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law before arriving at Wisconsin to lead its flagship state university in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an announcement sent to the Columbia campus on Sunday night, David Greenwald and Jeh Johnson, the co-chairs of Columbia University’s board of trustees, said that Dr. Mnookin would bring to Columbia “an exceptional academic and leadership pedigree and a reputation for building trust through listening and engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She is known as a thoughtful consensus builder who strives for excellence in every pursuit, bringing both vision and energy to the work of institutional leadership,” they said. “She will be a remarkable leader of our great university.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mnookin said in a statement that she was “honored and thrilled to join Columbia University at this important moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to working closely with faculty, students and staff, and with both our local and global community of alumni and friends, to advance the university’s critically important mission and to ensure that its teaching and research continue to contribute meaningfully to society,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Columbia, Dr. Mnookin will find a large, complex research university that has been coping with challenges on many fronts, including cuts to its research enterprise by the Trump administration and deep divisions over how it handled a burst of student protest activity on campus after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. At the University of Wisconsin, Dr. Mnookin also contended with student protests in 2024, charting a path that resulted in ending a student encampment while also seeking engagement with demonstrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her own academic background is something of a top-tier trifecta. She earned a bachelor’s degree from Harvard University, a law degree from Yale University and a doctorate in the history and social study of science and technology from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her academic work focuses on evidence, proof and decision making in the legal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her résumé has echoes of that of Lee Bollinger, who led Columbia between 2002 and 2023 and was a lawyer who had been president of the University of Michigan. In finding a candidate with deep roots in American academia, Columbia’s board appears to be trying to correct for its last hire, Nemat Shafik, a London economist who resigned in 2024 amid campus turmoil over the Gaza war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bollinger welcomed her appointment. “Jennifer Mnookin understands, at a deep level, what it means to lead a major research university in a complex and consequential moment,” he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbia’s campus was rocked by frequent, large demonstrations by students in favor of Palestinian self-determination, with some calling for the end of Israel as a Jewish state, using language that many Israeli and Jewish students found threatening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shafik, who had never led an American university, struggled to balance Columbia’s free speech traditions with the pressures that came from some students, parents, donors and congressional Republicans to shut the protests down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To contain the unrest, Dr. Shafik closed the main campus in Manhattan’s Morningside Heights neighborhood to the public; it remains so to this day. In April 2024, she testified before a congressional committee about the activism, calling it unacceptable, but the political pressure did not relent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbia’s student activists escalated tensions, putting up an encampment on a campus lawn. Dr. Shafik called the New York City police to make arrests, but hundreds of other students simply moved to the next lawn over. For nearly two weeks, they remained, sparking a wave of tent pro-Palestinian cities on other campuses around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When negotiations to end the encampment failed, a small group of students and outsiders took over a campus building. Dr. Shafik authorized the police to enter the building and arrest the occupiers, and the campus went into a lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With her leadership under fire on all fronts, Dr. Shafik resigned during the summer. Two interim leaders followed. Katrina Armstrong, the chief executive of Columbia’s medical school, came first, and negotiated with the Trump administration after it suspended more than $400 million in research grants because of what it called the school’s antisemitism problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She resigned following pressure from the White House, which had perceived that she was playing down the concessions that Columbia had made. The board then appointed one of its own trustees, Claire Shipman, a former television journalist, as the acting president until a permanent president could be chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Ms. Shipman, Columbia reached a deal in July with the White House, agreeing to pay $200 million to the federal government and $21 million to a fund to pay for claims from staff members that they experienced antisemitism. Nearly all the research grants were restored, and a tense calm returned to campus, even as anger about what critics blasted as Columbia’s capitulation persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Columbia searched for a new president, some faculty expressed concern that the trustees would select someone who would double down on Columbia’s growing emphasis on security over free expression. But Dr. Mnookin, based on her background, appears to be more of a moderate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she faced a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of Wisconsin in April 2024 that had been inspired by Columbia’s, she took a dual approach. She authorized the police to dismantle the encampment, after telling the protesters to disperse multiple times. But when the demonstrators reinstated their camp, much as they did at Columbia, she became involved with negotiations and reached an agreement with students to end the encampment peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the most fundamental missions of a university is and must be to foster engagement and dialogue across what can often feel like intractable differences,” she told her campus community in a letter in May 2024. “As we have navigated this past week, I have endeavored to listen to the concerns of the many people we have heard from and the many perspectives that have been represented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Ms. Shipman, the acting president, said Dr. Mnookin’s skill as a listener who “pulls people together” was a trait that stood out about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She’s able to navigate difficult political terrain, and, in fact, she isn’t afraid to dive into thorny issues,” she said. “She knows that is, in part, what universities are meant to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mnookin has also focused on affordability initiatives at Wisconsin. In addition, she launched a research initiative to invest in artificial intelligence, sustainability and human health. As of 2025, the university reclaimed a spot among the top five universities nationally for research expenditures, a milestone it had not hit in over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During her tenure, Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin brought unbounded energy, resilience and deeply thoughtful leadership to this great university,” Jay Rothman, the president of the Universities of Wisconsin system, said in the official announcement of her new post, which she will begin on July 1.&lt;/p&gt;
